CYP1A2 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and its expression is induced by some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are found in cigarette smoke. The enzyme's endogenous substrate is unknown; however, it is able to metabolize some PAHs to carcinogenic intermediates. Other xenobiotic substrates for this enzyme include caffeine, aflatoxin B1, and paracetamol (acetaminophen).

(y being \"obvious and immediately verifiable.....\")\n2. You stated \"not y(x)\" as a potential theorem/axiom\n3. From Necessication Rule of Modal Logic we get \"necessarily not y\" from 2.\n4. Theorem 1 of Godel's Proof. \n5. By contradiction with Theorem 1 y(x) is not a \"positive\" property. \n\nIf we accept your first objection as valid, it would mean that a valid method of disprove is to add a contradiction to the formal system and therefore say any proofs from the system is invalid. It would be logical and rational okay to simply, for example, say 2+2 does not equal four and after a long argument Quantum Mechanics is wrong. I hope that you would not accept that as a valid way of refuting arguments. I suggest looking at the axioms and figuring out which ones you disagree with. \n\nOn your second objection:\n\nThis directly contradicts Godel's second Axiom. And again we have the above problems. Again you are going to have to decide which of the Axioms you don't like. You can just start to add things against logical rules or we could have people invalidating things by, for example, stating that 2+2 does not equal four (which btw is true in some formal systems) and therefore QM is wrong.

It's a clip of her singing, and as odd as this sounds I was okay with listening to it because it's her doing what she loved in front of other people, if I just hear her voice talking normal on a voicemail I just feel like it'd do more harm than good at this point. I know it doesn't make sense, but thanks for your advice and I will heed it when the time comes. Also want to thank you and the others with similar experiences who have messaged me privately throughout yesterday to reach out and offer condolences and advice. Thank you so, so much\n\nLast year she came here to California with the dream of playing music, not even becoming famous or anything like that, just to be in a band and make music. She played guitar and sang, we played guitar together but she wouldn't sing in front of me because she was too shy. I was already impressed with her because she was a damn good guitar player, easily better than me, but I didn't push her to sing because I got it; I'm shy too.\n\nOne of her friends sent me a video of her singing karaoke in a bar last summer, a few months before we met. She sent it to me in December and I only listened to it last Tuesday night. I couldn't watch, so I just extracted the audio which I've included below. I've only listened to the recording a few times but it's been playing throughout the day in my head at various points since. It's beautiful, I think her voice was incredible and that's what I told her in the text I sent her the other night. That she had nothing to be shy or modest about and I wish I could have heard her sing in person. \n\nThis is her singing and having a good time and doing what she wanted to do, it's easier to listen to than say something \"normal\" like recording a voicemail. So against my better judgment, I'm sharing her singing with Reddit because I think she had an amazing voice, even though she was too shy to share it with me, I think she was great and I hope others enjoy it too. \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/8w23yb6z9ky0a7t/glorybox.mp3?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8w23yb6z9ky0a7t/glorybox.mp3?dl=0)\n\n&#x200B;", "title": "Redditors who haven't had sex for a long time, what has kept you from being active?", "num_comments": 1890, "downs": 0, "author": "t2_hswuc", "score": 1, "submitter": false, "ups": 1, "contro": 0}, "ejjg197": {"body": "Made rice on the stove.

The \"runaway stabilizer trim\" checklist for the 737 calls out for those cutoff switches to be used, and has for many years, which is why after the crash in Indonesia the FAA and Boeing put out bulletins which explained this possibility in depth and ended by reminding flight crews to use the existing procedure.

I suspect a large part of the problem is that on previous 737 variants, the automatic trim systems would be stopped by disconnecting the autopilot, which can be accomplished by pulling on the yoke, or using the disconnect switch on the yoke.

And Drax's line, \"we're not friends, we're family\" was just so cringey. Yea, I get it, the movie is all about dysfunctional family dynamics and loving each other nonetheless.

The whole thing was kinda sketch but I went because this friend-of-a-friend named Cassy who did a lot of DMT was apparently gonna go, and I was dying to do DMT at the time. When I got there I bought some DMT off Cassy and tried to find Sean, but for a bit I just chilled and talked to a couple of the people there. One of them was this super nice guy who seemed interested by the DMT so I offered him some but then the motherfucker smoked like 3/4 of what I had bought. I was pissed but still smoked what I had left and immediately felt the world going a little wild. By this point people started having sex and I was seeing crazy fractal patterns and shit everywhere\u2014this one group of people on the sofa morphed into a giant camel that just made eye contact with me for like a full minute. I sorta stumbled into another room and saw that one guy freaking the fuck out from the DMT, and I got pissed at him for taking my shit and my whole world erupted into flames and vengeance. I football tackled this dude into the refrigerator and we were both tripping the fuck out and screaming nonsense. We were closed-fist, frying pans and wooden spoons, straight up fighting until a bunch of the orgygoers from the living room came and like tore us apart. Sean was pissed and threw me out so I sat on the front lawn to wait out the trip, and a few minutes later they threw the other guy out too for being too rowdy I guess. He just sat down next to me and described what he saw (a giant stop sign-shaped face in the sky) and I was like \u201choly shit dude I\u2019m seeing exactly the same thing\u201d. We talked til we came down and the dude apologized for stealing my shit and gave me the $60 he had on him. When I left like 20 minutes later we finally exchanged named and I learned his was Prince.\n\nA few years later I was watching an interview with THE Prince on TV and was like \u201choly shit I know that guy\u201d. When I realized that I planned to buy VIP tickets to his next performance in my area, which happened to be a couple months later. I smoked some more DMT before going back to meet Prince and when I asked him if he remembered me he looked in my eyes which by that time were like black holes. He told me he wrote the song \u201cWhen Doves Fly\u201d about me but I don\u2019t remember much after that because a bunch of big ass pattern spiders attacked me and I kinda flipped out and was removed by security.\n\nI know this wasn\u2019t technically having sex with Prince but since the experience occurred at an orgy I hope it still counts.", "title": "People who have had sex with famous musicians from the 80s or 90s: who was it, and what was it like?", "num_comments": 6, "downs": 0, "author": "t2_kxjy8re", "score": 1, "submitter": false, "ups": 1, "contro": 0}, "ejjr6d6": {"body": "Because all the door to door ones here are smarmy lil wieners (yes I've been told these are rare at the door but we average 4 or 5 a year).

A ripe and juicy one.\n\n(Pause.)\n\nBEATRICE: I've never had a pear.\n\nVIRGIL: What?\n\nBEATRICE: In fact, I don't think I've ever set eyes on one.\n\nVIRGIL: How is that possible? It's a common fruit.\n\nBEATRICE: My parents were always eating apples and carrots. I\nguess they didn't like pears.\n\nVIRGIL: But pears are so good! I bet you there's a pear tree right around here. (He looks about.)\n\nBEATRICE: Describe a pear for me. What is a pear like?\n\nVIRGIL: (settling back) I can try. Let's see . . . To start with, a pear has an unusual shape. It's round and fat on the bottom, but tapered on top.\n\nBEATRICE: Like a gourd.\n\nVIRGIL: A gourd ? You know gourds but you don't know pears? How odd the things we know and don't. At any rate, no, a pear is smaller than an average gourd, and its shape is more pleasing to the eye. A pear becomes tapered in a symmetrical way, its upper half sitting straight and centred atop its lower half. Can you see what I mean?\n\nBEATRICE: I think so.\n\nVIRGIL: Let's start with the bottom half. Can you imagine a fruit that is round and fat?\n\nBEATRICE: Like an apple?\n\nVIRGIL: Not quite. If you look at an apple with your mind's eye, you will notice that the girth of the apple is at its widest either in the middle of the fruit or in the top third, isn't that so?\n\nBEATRICE: You're right. A pear is not like this?\n\nVIRGIL: No. You must imagine an apple that is at its widest in the bottom third.\n\nBEATRICE: I can see it.\n\nVIRGIL: But we must not push the comparison too far. The bottom of a pear is not like an apple's.\n\nBEATRICE: No?\n\nVIRGIL: No. Most apples sit on their buttocks, so to speak, on a circular ridge or on four or five points that keep them from falling over. Past the buttocks, a little ways up, there's what would be the anus of the fruit if the fruit were a beast.\n\nBEATRICE: I see precisely what you mean.\n\nVIRGIL: Well, a pear is not like that. A pear has no buttocks. Its bottom is round.\n\nBEATRICE: So how does it stay up?\n\nVIRGIL: It doesn't. A pear either dangles from a tree or lies on its side.\nBEATRICE: As clumsy as an egg.\n\nVIRGIL: There's something else about the bottom of a pear: most pears do not have those vertical grooves that some apples have. Most pears have smooth, round, even bottoms.\n\nBEATRICE: How enchanting.\n\nVIRGIL: It certainly is. Now let us move north past our fruity equator.\n\nBEATRICE: I'm following you.\n\nVIRGIL: There comes this tapering I was telling you about.\n\nBEATRICE: I can't quite see it. Does the fruit come to a point? Is it shaped like a cone?\n\nVIRGIL: No. Imagine the tip of a banana.\n\nBEATRICE: Which tip?\n\nVIRGIL: The end tip, the one you hold in your hand when you're eating one.\nBEATRICE: What kind of banana? There are hundreds of varieties.\n\nVIRGIL: Are there?\n\nBEATRICE: Yes. Some are as small as fat fingers, others are real clubs. And their shapes vary too, as do their taste.\n\nVIRGIL: I mean the regular, yellow ones that taste really good.\n\nBEATRICE: The common banana, M. sapientum. You probably have the Gros Michel variety in mind.\n\nVIRGIL: I'm impressed.\n\nBEATRICE: I know bananas.\n\nVIRGIL: Better than a monkey. Take the end tip of a common banana, then, and place it on top of an apple, taking into account the differences between apples and pears that I've just described.\n\nBEATRICE: An interesting graft.\n\nVIRGIL: Now make the lines smoother, gentler. Let the banana flare out in a friendly way as it merges into the apple. Can you see it?\n\nBEATRICE: I believe I can.\n\nVIRGIL: One last detail. At the very top of this apple-banana composite, add a surprisingly tough stalk, a real tree trunk of a stalk. There, you have an approximation of a pear.\n\nBEATRICE: A pear sounds like a beautiful fruit.\n\nVIRGIL: It is. In colour, commonly, a pear is yellow with black spots.\n\nBEATRICE: Like a banana again.\n\nVIRGIL: No, not at all. A pear isn't yellow in so bright, lustreless and opaque a way. It's a paler, translucent yellow, moving towards beige, but not creamy, more watery, approaching the visual texture of a watercolour wash. And the spots are sometimes brown.\n\nBEATRICE: How are the spots distributed?\n\nVIRGIL: Not like the spots on a leopard. It's more a matter of areas of shadowing than of real spots, depending on the degree of maturity of the pear. By the way, a ripe pear bruises easily, so it must be handled with care.\n\nBEATRICE: Of course.\n\nVIRGIL: Now the skin. It's a peculiar skin, the pear's, hard to describe. We were speaking of apples and bananas.\n\nBEATRICE: Yes.\n\nVIRGIL: They have smooth, slippery skins.\n\nBEATRICE: They do.\n\nVIRGIL: A pear does not have so smooth or slippery a skin.\n\nBEATRICE: Really?\n\nVIRGIL: It is so. A pear has a rougher skin.\n\nBEATRICE: Like an avocado's?\n\nVIRGIL: No. But since you mention avocados, a pear is somewhat shaped like an avocado, although the bottom of a pear is usually plumper.\n\nBEATRICE: Fascinating.\n\nVIRGIL: And a pear becomes thinner in its top half in a more pronounced way than an avocado does. Nonetheless, the two fruits are more or less similar in form.\n\nBEATRICE: I see the shape clearly.\n\nVIRGIL: But you cannot compare their skins! An avocado's skin is as warty as a toad's. An avocado looks like a vegetable with leprosy. The pear is characterized by a thin roughness, delicate and interesting to the touch. If you could magnify it a hundred times, do you know what it would sound like, the sound of fingertips running over the skin of a dry pear?\n\nBEATRICE: What?\n\nVIRGIL: It would sound like the diamond of a record player entering a groove. That same dancing crackle, like the burning of the driest, lightest kindling.\n\nBEATRICE: A pear is surely the finest fruit in the world!\n\nVIRGIL: It is, it is! That's the skin of a pear for you.\n\nBEATRICE: Can one eat it?\n\nVIRGIL: Of course. We're not talking here of the waxy, thuggish skin of an orange. The skin of a pear is soft and yielding when ripe.\n\nBEATRICE: And what does a pear taste like?\n\nVIRGIL: Wait. You must smell it first. A ripe pear breathes a fragrance that is watery and subtle, its power lying in the lightness of its impression upon the olfactory sense. Can you imagine the smell of nutmeg or cinnamon?\n\nBEATRICE: I can.\n\nVIRGIL: The smell of a ripe pear has the same effect on the mind as these aromatic spices. The mind is arrested, spellbound, and a thousand and one memories and associations are thrown up as the mind burrows deep to understand the allure of this beguiling smell \u2014 which it never comes to understand, by the way.\n\nBEATRICE: But how does it taste? I can't wait any longer.\n\nVIRGIL: A ripe pear overflows with sweet juiciness.\n\nBEATRICE: Oh, that sounds good.\n\nVIRGIL: Slice a pear and you will find that its flesh is incandescent white. It glows with inner light. Those who carry a knife and a pear are never afraid of the dark.\n\nBEATRICE: I must have one.\n\nVIRGIL: The texture of a pear, its consistency, is yet another difficult matter to put into words. Some pears are a little crunchy.\n\nBEATRICE: Like an apple?\n\nVIRGIL: No, not at all like an apple! An apple resists being eaten. An apple is not eaten, it is conquered. The crunchiness of a pear is far more appealing. It is giving and fragile. To eat a pear is akin to . . . kissing.\n\nBEATRICE: Oh, my. It sounds so good.\n\nVIRGIL: The flesh of a pear can be slightly gritty. And yet it melts in the mouth.\n\nBEATRICE: Is such a thing possible?\n\nVIRGIL: With every pear. And that is only the look, the feel, the smell, the texture. I have not even told you of the taste.\n\nBEATRICE: My God!\n\nVIRGIL: The taste of a good pear is such that when you eat one, when your teeth sink into the bliss of one, it becomes a wholly engrossing activity. You want to do nothing else but eat your pear. You would rather sit than stand. You would rather be alone than in company. You would rather have silence than music. All your senses but taste fall inactive. You see nothing, you hear nothing, you feel nothing\u2014or only as it helps you to appreciate the divine taste of your pear.\n\nBEATRICE: But what does it actually taste like?\n\nVIRGIL: A pear tastes like, it tastes like . . . (He struggles. He gives up with a shrug.) I don't know. I can't put it into words.
