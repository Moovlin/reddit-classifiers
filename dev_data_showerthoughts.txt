A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.\n\nBecause eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.\n\nMany herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...\n\nKoalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.\n\nBeing mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).\n\nWhen the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.\n\nThis partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why?\n\nBecause koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.\n\nDespite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:\n\nKoalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.\n\nAn animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.\n\nTldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.\n\nIf you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.\n", "title": "Descendants of Africans who were not enslaved are doing worse than descendants of Africans who were", "num_comments": 13, "downs": 0, "author": "t2_mhor3", "score": 1, "submitter": false, "ups": 1, "contro": 0}, "ejk9lxs": {"body": "Fooding punchone's their while eating face is the worstest.

Since Reaganomics in 1983, the top 1% has just exponentially gained wealth in relation to GDP.  The upper Middle class (which is about 150k not 250k) has stayed around the GDP, and the other 90% below it.\n\nBut yes, a poor person can make 600 in a day if they do something like lawn maintenance.   Hence why I gave that example.  It's low overhead, and you can make decent money. \n\nAt 250k, you have enough money for anything you want.  My girlfriend makes about that much and she has 4 houses, and can buy what she wants when she wants.  Especially after she finishes paying off the last house and makes another 4k/mo.\n\nI'm not saying that cards aren't stacked against poor people, but just look at someone like the creator of whatsapp.  He learned to code by himself, and created an app that made him a millionaire (billionaire?).  Anyone can turn a skill into money.  Or even join the military for a free education that you can build from.  \n\nI've seen so many people that were struggling or on welfare change their life around and be in a position that they no longer struggle with money not to believe you can't do it.  I'm not saying poor people are lazy.  What I'm saying is they, like myself, aren't necessarily motivated or educated enough to figure out how to get out of poverty.  Not everyone can be rich, there will always be \"poor\" people because that's how wealth distributes; even if we fix the economy and bring it where the mid 50% are the middle class again, you'll still have the poorer lower class.

You can also say that we are bunch of cells, if you zoom out from atoms. Or you can say we are a bunch of protons and neutrons, if you zoom in. You can zoom in even more and \u201csee\u201d probability fields of energy. Yet if we say that, we are just looking at the same thing, but with different lenses. Definitely helps us understand life though, especially when you consider quantum physics and how everything is just wave/particle vibration.\n\nWhen you say, we are such and such, it implies a question of \u201cwhat are we?\u201d, which has been my huge recurring shower thought. I am just trying to expand on what you said by saying that we are an information of how those atoms are arranged, which I know sounds weird. Hear me out, small things put together in a right order create a new unit of existence, a lot of times with new attributes. Take 1 proton and you get a Hydrogen atom, combine 2 of them and you will get Helium (not bunch of Hydrogens). Combine 79 of them and you get gold. You can say that gold is 79 hydrogens squished together, but what makes gold is 79, which is a number/information. A single gold atom is 100% identical to another gold atom with the same number of protons and neutrons. So what attribute defines gold in the context of other atoms? 79.\n\nAgain, not trying to attack your idea. Just trying to expand. I am stuck here too.

Cobalt deficiency leads to B12 deficiency which leads to wasting syndrome and a number of other problems like dead calves.  We give it to them for their health, not ours.  We eat them for our health.\n\nCobalamin and it's analogues are only produced by bacterium through fermentation, ie - in ruminating animal guts.  Dietary cobalt is necessary for this.  While it's present in grasslands, it's concentration in the plants varies significantly thanks to many factors (rain, plant growth rate, field utilization, soil conditions, etc).  One year, pasture fed animals could be perfectly healthy.  The next could produce severe Cobalt deficiencies and all of the babies could die.  The next year could be back to optimal again.  It's a source of variability that's bad for their health and our business.  So, we give them cobalt in their feed, either in the form of raw dietary cobalt or with actual B12 in feed or by injection.\n\nApart from gut flora processing cobalt, the only other source for B12 is meats, notably organ meats.
