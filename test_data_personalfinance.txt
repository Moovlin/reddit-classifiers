When you're choosing which debt to pay off, you should pay off the smaller, or the higher interest rate, while maintaining payments for the other.  But first you have to stop building debt.  Since credit card minimum payments are required to at least be more than the interest accrued, and since they're required to tell you how long it takes to pay off the card at minimum payment rates (my 5k card was 29 years, and I'd end up paying 5x the amount owed), then you obviously added to the tab.\n\nYou may need to consult a nonprofit credit counselling service.

Even if you know nothing about real estate, if you've got grit and motivation, it's extremely doable. Here's how it works: \n\nThe trick to house hacking is to use an FHA loan. This loan allows first time homebuyers to buy a 1-4 unit house with only 3.5% down. In any other case, for a multi family investment property the bank would require 25-30% down. In essence you are leveraging 96.5% of the cost, and using that money to live for free and make even more money. Other upsides:\n\n* The FHA loan gives you the best interest rates available, because it's designed to incentivize owning a home.\nThis loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, so it can be used in any state.\n* The loan can be used to purchase a property that's well above what you could normally \"afford.\" The bank uses the income from the other units and applies it to your income to debt ratio. In my case, I was making around $17/hr at the time but the bank took an extra $1100/month each from the other 3 units and applied it to my income. That's how I was able to afford a $350k house despite low wages.\n* The only requirement to use the loan is that you move in within 90 days after the closing, and that you occupy the property for 365 days following the closing. Realistically, you could move 1 year and 1 day after the closing, buy another house, and rent out the unit you occupied. No strings attached.\n* Say you wanted to move across the country or visit Europe for 3 months at a time. The nice thing about your property is that it's an investment property. You can hire a property manager to run it, and still make plenty of money on it. In any other case, a home purchase ties you to one location for at least 5 years. With this loan, you can own an investment while still having the freedom to do what you want. If I were to move next week and hire a manager, I'd still be making $800/month profit, never having to step foot there again.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of the financials, from my real-life example:\nPurchase price: $350k\nDown payment: $12,250\nClosing costs: $14,000\nShort term repairs: $8,000\nTotal: $34,250\n\nOf those, I negotiated $3,000 off the price to fix things the seller didn't want to fix. I also received a $3900 lender cash credit for a slightly higher rate (4.125% instead of 4%). I then financed $3500 of the repair amounts for 2 years at 0% interest using a Lowe's credit card. So $10,400 of the cash needed was taken off. In all, I invested $23,850 of my own money for this deal.", "title": "Is it a good time to purchase a house?

When you pay down the principal, you're essentially converting your money into a share of the house (or car or whatever) you own.\n\nYou can think of paying down principal as shrinking the horizontal size of the amoritzation chart I linked before.

The best piece of advice as someone who has studied financial markets, and manages millions of dollars for a living is: TAKE RISK! You have no business being in fixed income at your age, so just remove that thought from your mind if it even exists. Concentrate yourself in predominately mid and small cap, over time you will outperform large cap by hundreds of percent. Mid and small cap are volatile. The S&P500 will be down -5%, and you\u2019ll be down -15%. On the upside the S&P500 will be up 5%, and you\u2019ll be up 15%. Just don\u2019t be emotional, and stay long and strong. For large cap I recommend using ETF\u2019s as they are efficient markets. My core large caps are VOO, RSP, DIA, & QQQ. For mid and small, I just use money managers as they\u2019re inefficient markets. Clearbridge has phenomenal money managers that are rarely talked about.

Paying on time is a great factor, but it doesn\u2019t mean you purchase 100 today and pay it after a week will dramatically increase your score, this is not how it works. This is all base on my experience and what I seen so far. They increase your score if they are making money out of you. Let say you swipe for $200 then you pay 100, and then you carry on the $100 balance for the next statement which will get interest, then pay for the next month the whole thing. Bank gets about 50 cents to $2 on this transaction depends on your APR. which is good for them and they will report you as a good borrower. My score is 770+ which I use a card monthly and pay on every statement. My brother did swipe 500 on the same provider and he pay 150 every month which he got interest and his score sky rocket every month with 15 to 30 points to 820+\nBut it took 2-5 months before this score took its peak. \n\nLength of credit card, it doesn\u2019t mean you have an open account and not using it will help you. No! If you left a card sitting for too long the provider will close it. To have a good standing card use it once or twice a month unless it has a carry on balance.\n\nCredit utilization. This is what kicks you. Keep your credit utilization lower to 35% anything above 50% hurts your score. If you have 1000 credit card limit, keep your usage to 300-400. \n\nOther factor to increase or lower your score is loan.

I was in a similar position 3 years ago (living in midwest job offer in seattle).  For me, the pay increase was a wash or slightly less after cost of living.  My wife is also a teacher.  Luckily (or unluckily) she has two degrees.  In WA, she actually makes more for having that second degree which bumped her pay up considerably from what she was making in the midwest.  So once we factored in her pay (and cost of living) we were slightly above what we were making in the midwest - barely.  After some thoughtful consideration we decided to do it because we were young(er) and did not have any kids so we thought if we were gonna do it then it was the best time to do it.  We were also banking on the fact that I would within the next few years either 1) move up at the new company and get a salary increase 2) get some experience at my new job and then go work somewhere else in the tech-heavy seattle area and make more.  I ended up doing both - and in the end I make over double what I made in the midwest and my wife is going to to school to get her masters currently and once she has that, she will be making double what she makes in the midwest.  Our retirement accounts are thanking us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut this is just my story though with a lot of good fortune sprinkled in.  Keep in mind, homes in the Seattle are are cheap **COMPARED** to the SF area.  If owning a home is important to you and your wife, I don't see how that could be a good move.  A friend of mine took a job at a tech company in the SF area 4 years ago with a $175k/yr salary.  He bought a 3 bedroom duplex unit for $800k two years ago that is over an hour away from where he works.  You won't be making that much...  I'm not sure where you are at in the midwest but where i was from (tornado alley region) you could get a 3-4 bedroom home (2200 sqft) for around $140-150k with a 15 minute or less drive to work.  In Seattle area, you are looking at $400-750k depending on the area (suburbs - not Seattle proper) with an hour drive to work.  In SF area...Probably close to a $1 million with at least an hour drive to work, likely more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't regret moving.  If I had to do it all over again though I'm not sure I would.  We do like it here, but man, people.  There are people everywhere. There is traffic everywhere.  I do miss the slow pace of the midwest, large parking spots, free parking, no traffic, and cheap living.  Don't undervalue the importance of family.  I love our family but I didn't think living far away from them would be a big deal.  It is, especially when you start having kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat all being said, if you're young with no family and your wife is on board and you guys want to do it.  Then do it.

Start off by getting a copy of \"Your money or your Life\" by vicki robin. This book does a great job of breaking down your salary into what you actually get paid. \n\nSo if you make about $38 per hour (which is what I believe you make $80k/ 52 weeks/ 40 hours). The book would say your hourly wage is actually much lower than that because it factors in time and expenses related to the job that you are not paid for. So if you spend 2 hours a day in a car to get to work, then you are actually allocating 50 hours a week to work. So if you make 80K/52/50 hours your real hourly wage is closer to $30. Plus you said you skip lunch and don't take any breaks, so you probably work more than 40 Probably 45 plus the 10 hours of driving per week. So it might look like this $80k/52/55 = $28 per hour.\n\nNow factor in what you pay for gas, vehicle wear and tear, and any other expenses related directly to your job and you are probably well below $25 per hour. $25*40*52= a realistic salary of $52,000 (but you are paying taxes on 80k).\n\nCould you realistically find a closer job and lower your commuting expense? Could you find a job where you get breaks and actually work close to a 40 hour week? Say you get a job that pays $65K but you only have to drive 30 minutes per day and you only work 40 hours a week. You would see $65K/52/42.5= a realistic wage of $29.41 per hour or a real salary of $61k (which is higher than what you are currently making now after you account for time in traffic, wear and tear on your vehicle, and working an extra hour per day with no breaks or lunch...)\n\nCan you have your wife's job cover healthcare and dental? Also, does your wife have a 401k program? If she does, you can max out her 401k for both of you. Besides, you are 28. You have more than enough time to start investing in another 401k/roth. \n\nYou won't get to touch your $3000 pension for another 30+ years anyway. Besides, with no debt, you guys could max out 401ks and roths every year and be multi-millionaires in a short time.\n\nIf she has healthcare, I would enroll in her companies plan, secure a job that is closer, less stressful and has a better culture where you work closer to 40 hours per week.\n\nRead the rest of the book. It goes on to explain how to view the dollars you spend on everything into how many hours it took you to earn that money. The book is designed to show you how to reduce spending on things you don't need in order to reduce expenses and maximize saving/investing. This allows people to be financially independent and retire early, or get a lower paying job that is less stressful.\n\n", "title": "Can I just quit / find a lower paying job and then quit?

They also clearly aren't completely opposed to paying more money for good work, as I've seen reflected in pay increases in my coworkers' paychecks. They do a good amount of touting their company as valuing loyalty, longevity and investment in their employees.. I know that is pretty typical of all companies, but they have invested in me a fair amount (they gave me 5 days PTO within a few months of working there even though I'm not on salary, bought me a new computer, etc).

You're going to either have new car loans, pay cash for new cars, or pay for a lot of repairs. Source: a few years ago we had to buy two new cars at almost the same time and now have two car payments and it sucks.  I would look at it as a certain amount of money you pay each month/year for a car which can be either a car loan, or saving to pay cash for a car, or repairing your cars.\n\nYou don't account for health insurance after you stop working. I personally am not counting on a public option.\n\nI am 49 and while I love my kids (age 13 and 15), college is very expensive and we can't comfortably make any retirement decisions until we know how much college will cost and are certain that they're gainfully employed post-college.  We used to budget $100k per kid for college but are finding that it might cost more than that, maybe substantially more, or maybe we will get lucky and they'll get a scholarship or something.  So this is basically a $0-500k potential cost hanging over our finances. There are also possible disaster scenarios where they have trouble getting a degree, or get a degree that doesn't lead to a job and are financially dependent on us for longer than we anticipate. The cost of college has increased at much faster than inflation too so this is likely to impact your long term picture and is very hard to ignore.\n\nYour 401k additions will probably go up every year as your salaries increase.\n\nI would not necessarily count on 30 years of appreciation of your house, which doesn't happen in many areas of the country, and you may sell the house or move into an area with different/no appreciation.\n\nAll of that said your assumptions about investments growth are conservative and many people have retired on a lot less. It depends on what \"retirement\" means to you, if it means cutting back on work or quitting entirely. 55-65 year olds need to stay busy just like 33 year olds. For example my personal plan is to cut back to working about 6 months out of the year doing contract work and get some travel out of it so I still have a social network and the ability to travel, but also have 3-6 months to myself per year.  I know a bunch of people in the 50-70 age range that do this.

That would put you at $12,258.\n\nI know you said that money is a little tight right now, so lets assume you refinanced that for 38 months, ending in March 2023 (so a year shorter than your current loan), AND you paid a higher interest rate because it's a used car. @ 5% and 48 months, that would put you right around $282/month. Depending on your credit, you should easily be able to find a rate at or below 5%. \n\nThis would free up $174/month.\n\n----------\n\nYou can't change the fact that you got hosed on the original loan. You're going to have to chalk that up to the cost of education category. But refinancing will definitely help you with your month to month situation AND puts you in a position to get ahead of the loan which makes it easier for you to get rid of it later. \n\nI would be hesitant to jump straight to the conclusion that you should get rid of this vehicle and get a $10k used car. You already have a $10k used car, and at least with this one you already know the history of it and don't have to play the game of \"what's wrong with this one\".\n\nIf you used dealer financing, I would caution AGAINST paying down the current loan with the $10k lump sum. If they're predatory enough to offer you an 8 year loan, they may also be predatory enough to include pre-payment penalties in the loan, and you're very unlikely to experience a decrease in monthly payment on the vehicle, so that won't improve your financial situation. Take your cash, and your loan paperwork to your bank or your local credit union and tell them what you want to do - they can handle the details of paying off the previous loan and taking your cash as a downpayment on the new loan. You should just focus on the interet rate, length of the loan, and monthly payments. \n\n\n------\n\nLastly, please take this as a lesson in car purchases. \n\n1. Never let the dealer play the \"what are you looking to pay each month\" game. It's a chance for them to move the numbers around the board and add in other fees and addons at your expense.\n\n2. Next time, either pay cash, or shop around for the best rate before hand. They chahnged theh way credit checks work a few years ago, so if you're shopping for multiple auto loans at the same time trying to find the best rate, that will ultimately count as one hard inquiry at the end of the process not 3-5 or whatever. Walking into a dealershhip with a preapproval in your pocket gives you a lot of power. For one, it gives you something to compare against so you can tell easier when you're being fleeced by the finance manager. Secondly, it gives you the best position to negotiate by either letting you get the best deal on the car you can and then using your own financing, or leveraging even more bargaining power (more discounts, lower rates) to switch to their financing. \n\n3. Next time you go buy a car, you should look at it as 3 completely separate transactions. \n\n* Transaction one is the negotiation on the price of the vehicle you intend to buy. You should try to do this in a vacuum, ignoring the financing and trade-in portion. Keep in mind that the sales guys job is to try to muddy the water and get you to discuss all three at once. RESIST. \n* Transaction 2 is negotiating over the value of your potential trade in. Having a KBB price can help a little bit, but they got bought out by . part of the industry a few years ago, and their numbers aren't actually completely in your best interest. If there's a carmax nearby, they're usually somewhere in between private party and trade-in price (but closer to tradein price). It might be worht an hour of your time to take the potential trade in, and let them give you a free offer. That offer is good for 7 days. If you walk into the car dealership to purchase your next car and get through step one and make it to the trade in negotiation phase, you now once again have options. By knowing what carmax would offer you, you have a baseline to judge their offer from. If/when they lowball you, you can ask them to counter at the carmax price. If they do, great -if not, you can ask them to write you a written quote for the vehicle you want to buy and hold it for you for 24 hours. You can then drive right back across town and sell your car to carmax for the price they quoted you for earlier, and then go back to the dealer and get the car you wanted. \n* Transaction number 3 is negotiating the financing. Before you ever set foot on the dealers lot, go to your bank/CU and get a pre-approval. They're going to be less likely to fleece you. For them, its very formulaic - here's your income, here's your credit score, here's your downpayment, here's how much we think you can afford so hhere are the terms (rate/length) that we can offer you. Now, when you go to the dealer, you already know you're not going to walk out with anything worse than what you've already been approved for. Don't tell them that you already have financing until you've settled on a final price for the car and the tradein price of your current vehicle. They're 99% of the time going to ask to run your credit to see if they can beat it. Since they revamped the way inquiries count on your credit report, there's not really much harm in letting them do that. They're either going to come back with a rate that meets or beats your preapproval, or they won't. I used Navy Federal and they usually have great rates, and the finance guys are pretty upfront about when they know they can't beat your preapproval and don't waste peoples time (but then they'll try to push their paint protectors and extra warranties and shit even harder, so be aware). If they come back with a better rate on the same terms, as long as its from a reputable bank, you're probably okay to take it. Sometimes they'll come back with a special rate (0% or something like that) through the manufacturer if you're buying new, and those are usually fine to take too - just make sure that if they tack on a finance fee that you run the numbers and ensure they didn't just shift the interest into a flat fee upfront (in which case you probably want to stick with your own financing.) They MIGHT try to come back with a close, but higher rate from a reputable bank and try to push it on you. You could refuse straightup, or you can counter that you'll consider their rate but they need to come down more on the out the door price to compensate for the higher interest. They might do this because they want to push the unit out the door, and you might let them because you can either get a lower total cost of purchase over time, or you can take the discount, and refinance to a lower rate down the road anyways and get the best of both worlds.", "title": "I bought too much car.

In short, that basically means each \"branch\" of the family gets equal shares, and it spreads out as you'd expect if people in the branch die.  For example, assume you have three kids, A, B, and C.  A and B have kids of their own, A1 and A2, and B1, B2, and B3.  C has no kids.  A passes away before you do.  Then you pass away.  Your estate is set to distribute per stirpes.  C gets 1/3rd.  B gets 1/3rd, but A1 and A2 each get 1/6th (A would've gotten 1/3rd, but A died and A's descendents share equally the 1/3rd that would've gone to A.  Or as a more concrete example, if my in-laws have their estate set as per stirpes, then their son will get 1/2 but my two kids will get 1/4 each because their mom, my in-laws' daughter, died, and so they share her 1/2.\n\nAlso, this is yet another reminder for all of us that we need to do proper estate planning.

Plan for your financial future better than they did first and then plan for their financial future better than they did. Establish good practices for yourself while you are young, save early and often, don't live an extravagant life style that you can't afford, and find solutions to the problems that life is going to throw at you.  You and your brother should have a long happy lives ahead of you, sadly that does not mean there won't be struggles but I'm sure you can find solutions.  \n\nMy biggest piece of advice though is to get more creative with a solution to this problem. Do not hastily look for a quick out or a magic fix. You will only throw good money after bad if you do, so be prepared for this to take time. Thankfully because you are young, time is on your side.  \n\nI would encourage you and your brother to research financial independent/retire early principals (FI/RE) and approaches to saving and making money, not necessarily with the intent of retiring early yourselves though that may be achievable, but rather to help you discover how much money you and your parents need and how to fund those needs with passive income and frugality. The main reason I'm suggesting doing this by researching FI/RE right now is because there is a lot of information freely available right now on these topics, as well as some very helpful communities that come from similar situations. Reading over nearly any FI/RE blog or community you will find plenty of examples of people who have started off from a place of financial weakness and have learned skills and knowledge to help find their way out and to build systems that can keep them protected from going backwards financially. There again, it's not a magic pill that will solve all your problems, but I do believe it can help you find workable solutions for your family.\n\nJust as an example, your parents have a modest income now so I'm sure they live relatively modest lives, the advantage to that being you aren't having to find a solution to replace a $200k/year income but rather a $40k/year income which equates to about $3,333/month. Over time if you can build small passive income streams for yourself or your parents that add up to at least half of that then you have likely set them up for retirement with the addition of Social Security benefits and the expected reduced cost of living in retirement. It will take work for you to find what works for you, is sustainable, and can work passively. This means you aren't having to work a full-time job for your needs and another full or part-time job to meet your parents needs.  \n\nThanks to your parents you aren't burdended with debt, regardless of their intent, they have given you a much better foundation to start with than many get. Being an adult means you get to decide how you repay that to them, so don't get caught up in the comments of people who feel your parents have wronged you or done something against your will. They did what they did with their own motives, be it love or control, don't let yourself be bitter or overly put upon by their choices.  Make choices and take actions that reflect how you feel about what they did for you and the value it has or will have in your life.\n\n", "title": "My parents just confessed to me that they used all their retirement income on my brother and i\u2019s tuition.

I did the math a few weeks ago and realized I make WAY more money per month than I actually have in bills. My biggest issues are very similar:\n\n1. I'm a social drinker. Its what happens when you're ex service industry and all your friends still bartend. Since I have no desire to throw away my social life, I've started brainstorming ways to save $ while still maintaining my friendships/fun. For example, we used to \"pregame\" back in college before we went out. I never do that now that I'm 28. I'll consume all of my alcohol for the night in the bar, which means spending a ton of money. I recently got a massive bottle of Kirkland vodka and a Kirkland gin, so I'm trying out the pregame method like we used to do when we were young. A few drinks at home before going out will make me buy WAY less out. I'm also trying to get myself to order cheaper items. This is a tough one. I love craft beer. Ordering a Rolling Rock when all I want is my favorite hazy IPA is HARD. And what's even harder is that the ABV of cheap beer is so much lower than craft beer that I still end up spending a lot. So hopefully, the combination of pregame + switching to cheaper items will help. There's always the ole flask fallback as well. Not so much for in bars like an asshole, but it is festival season in my city (blues fest, jazz fest, art fest, etc.) where you bring a blanket and lawn chairs and hang out all day watching bands play. Rather than buy beer at $6/pop from the vendors, better to just bring your own. These festivals are free to the public and take place across numerous public streets/lawns, so you're not likely to get caught with your own drink.\n\n2. Same as you on the eating out. I'll be doing so good.. and then I'll get major cabin fever from the healthy boring eating I've been doing and go out with a friend and spend $200 between dinner and bars. Entirely defeats the purpose of saving all week leading up. So I'm trying some new things here as well. I live in a college town, so there are specials somewhere almost every night. 50 cent wing night, $2 large beer night, $10 all you can drink open bar night, $5 gourmet burger plus fries night, etc. Plus several places have happy hour menus with several items for $5. Between all of that, you can actually have a pretty thriving social life while saving money. And I think if I did more of this, I wouldn't have the urge to \"binge\" on Friday night and have a blowout dinner with friends.\n\n3. Finally, I'm JUST LIKE YOU. I'm too nice. \"Oh, put your money away.. I got it\" is such a common phrase from me that its ridiculous. Especially if we are somewhere I wanted to go and I wanted that person with me. I need to start letting them pay for their own stuff, even if it means extra work for the bartender. I need to start requesting separate checks when we sit down, instead of going 50-50 at a restaurant when I had a $12 salad and they had a $30 entree + dessert. This is the hardest one for me to break. I don't think my friends are taking advantage of me or expect anything from me, but the shift in behavior might also make me look like I'm being cheap. Especially since it varies from friend to friend. Some of my friends are as generous as me.\n\nMy eyes were opened recently when I ate with someone who gave the waitress our 2 credit cards to split 50-50 at a restaurant when my total should have been $20 and his was $50. Instead, we each had to pay $35 before tip.. and then I tipped my normal generous one while he tipped ELEVEN PERCENT. I ended up spending more on a meal where he ordered dramatically more than I did.

The amount of dedication and amount of work required to get to those points are huge and if you are not fully dedicated to it, the rewards aren't going to be worth it to you.  Physician burnout (nurses, and I'm sure other care jobs too) is a very real issue as well.\n\nWhat I would recommend right now is to try out different things, and if possible, finds ways to combine them with your current education.  One of my internships was to use my IT skills (which at the time was fixing computers and MS Office) to help assist writing a research paper.  It involved medical chart lookups that utilized my pre-med education + IT skills in how to store data and get info out.  I'm still doing that today, coming up with IT solutions in the healthcare field.\n\nThe other thing I'd recommend is to wait on further education until you have a job in the field you want to work in, unless circumstances require differently.  Once I figured out that my internship could be a career, that's when I made a move to get a masters in Health Informatics.  In the program, I encountered many people who didn't have experience in the field yet, asking me about job opportunities.  I'm sure many of them were appalled halfway through the program when they realized that they would not get any experience with EPIC, the dominant electronic health record system in the region.  They'd be getting an advanced degree that combines IT and healthcare, but when asked in an interview, they would have no experience in how to deal with a standard EHR for their hospital.  Maybe not game breaking, but certainly a hindrance if you are expecting a masters to make up for no experience.  I've had other friends who get the masters before they have job experience and they always seem to struggle a bit more. \n\nThese are just my experiences.  Maybe others will tell you different so take my advice with a grain of salt!  What worked for me: Go out and try new things, bring in your experience to other industries, wait on further education until you know its what you want to do.

This may not be news to you but thought I'll clarify.\n* If you havent yet, definitely max out on 401K especially if you have employer matching.

Debt to income ratio is measured by taking all monthly debts from your credit report over your gross, monthly income. Most conventional mortgage options will not allow that number to be over 45-50%, depending  on downpayment and other factors.\n\nIf you can qualify for the mortgage and you are comfortable with the payment without refinancing the student loans, I would wait until after closing.

The first 3 years you were able to use the IRA deduction but the last 2 years your income was too high so those contributions were non-deductible. In those 2 years you file a form with your taxes saying that you made non-deductible contributions.\n\nThen 20 years later your IRA has grown to $100,000 and you are old enough to take the money out so you take out $30,000. You take your total of non-deductible contributions divided by total value and calculate that 10% of your IRA is composed of after-tax contributions. So then 10% of your distribution is non-taxable. You will show an IRA distribution of $30,000 with only $27,000 being taxable. You will still have another $7,000 of of non-deductible contributions left in your $70,000 remaining balance of your IRA. Next year you will use $7,000 as the numerator divided by whatever the new total value is.\n\nThis is also how backdoor Roth conversions work when you have other traditional IRAs. It is called the pro rata rule.

The company  is protecting themselves on this, and you need to protect you. \n\nIf this is a mistake, which it likely isn\u2019t, you\u2019re messing with more than HR and more than some numbers on a computer screen. Investment activities are regulated by the SEC and the IRS manages retirement fund contribution tax issues.  They will find the error, and no matter how stupid you act (or really are) you will absolutely be held accountable for making it right. \n\nImagine that you somehow get through the next 8 years without the IRS catching it, 25 years with your company never catching it, and the rest of your life with your retirement plan administrators never catching it. That\u2019s not gonna happen. So as the $500 dollars (or whatever) sits in your account gathering interest, when they do catch it, you will owe every penny of that back - including the interest it has gathered.

Don't think in terms of % deductions, but rather a true value.  If you were to put this on the market and sell it to someone else, what would you realistically expect to walk away with?  Consider the realtor expenses and anything else that you would need to put into the home either before listing or things that the buyer might ask for.  Also, unless your home is in a really hot market, the buyer would make an offer less than what you listed it for.  Say you listed at 400k, you might end up selling for $390k.\n\nIt depends on how much effort you want to put into it.  But, just shooting from the hip, I'd say 5% for realtor, 1/2% for repairs or fixing up (which could really be much more depending on the home), and 2% discount to buyer (you can get a better - realtors do keep stats on typical sales above/below listing price).

If she isn't prepared to place her mother in legal jeopardy, she's probably just going to want to call the card issuers and ask to close the accounts without disclosing that they were not opened by her in the first place. Following this, she should be freezing her credit with all 3 major bureaus. I would also add opening a card with Discover, since they have a free credit monitoring service for cardholders.

We also called our cable company and leveraged a lower monthly as a competitor wanted us to switch and offered us a fantastic deal. Our cable company matched it. One of the biggest expenses we had was going out for food. We would habitually buy lunch at work and dinner, eat out on the weekends for most meals; it was crazy how much money we spent eating out alone. With You Need a Budget, it helped us realize we could grocery shop for 3-4 days without spoilage (bad meat/poultry) and spend about half of our restaurant budget on healthier foods. We saw how much we were saving and weighed the pros and cons of snowballing vs. the avalanche method ([comparison here](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/get-out-of-debt-snowballing-stacking/)) for beginning consolidating our debt. We decided on the snowball method as we had many small lines and it made sense to tackle them that way to work up to our auto loans, student debt and eventually our mortgage. We are doing well, have a $6k (and growing) emergency fund, are coming up on an international vacation, but still have more work to do. For us, it takes monthly check-ins with our budget to make sure we're on track and we've definitely had to re-center at times, but we're on a good road and we're dedicated to be debt free in the next few years. The thing that helped us the most is having goals. We use the SMART method to formulate them so that we are accountable for our successes and failures, which we learn from. SMART stands for: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Oriented. This helps us create tangible financial goals for the short term, mid-term and long term. I hope that some of this will help you with your journey with finances.

If your mom is in the nursung home because she cannot care for herself, then Medicare will not pay and your mother is financially responsible. It sounds like your mother is in the latter situation. If she can't take care of herself, you as the POA will have to decide on a plan. That's what the nursing home wants to know. Are you going to pay for your mom to remain there? Or are you going to find other accommodations? Can she live with you? Can she go back home with a caregiver? \n\nCheck out the Alzheimer's Association.

As part of this, we create a monthly budget, where we assign our expected income to different categories & keep track of our savings.  It is actually a modified (improved?) version of the Dave Ramsey approach.\n\nI shared our progress [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2cvowb/triumphant_thursday_thread_for_the_week_of_august/cjjgalq/) back in Aug 2014, after a year at it, when we crossed from a negative net worth to a positive net worth.\n\nI shared [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/66hjpv/triumphant_thursday_thread_for_the_week_of_april/dgilnky/) in April 2017, just to show we had continued our positive trajectory.\n\nI now share a [third installment](https://i.imgur.com/SEQmlNH.png), April 2019 edition.  We have kept to our budgeting, and kept our worth increasing, handling various \"bumps\" along the way.  \n\n2017 was a hectic year.  In May 2017, we found out my wife was pregnant with twins, so we *had* to replace her '07 Accord with an SUV large enough for two car seats.  We had various medical bills related to the pregnancy throughout the year, culminating with the delivery & hospital bills in December 2017 ($16k total).  On top of that (and all the other nursery & baby gear-related expenses), my wife got put on modified bed rest 5 months into the pregnancy - so we lost her portion of our income for the rest of the year.\n\nI'm not complaining, we have done great.  We are very fortunate to have her mother to take care of the girls while we work during the day.  If we didn't have that, it wouldn't be worth it for my wife to go back to work, due to the cost of daycare.\n\nOver the past twelve months, we've averaged a net worth increase of $4860/month - roughly 57% of our pre-tax salaries.  We plan to keep it up!  \n\nThis subreddit was invaluable to me in the \"early days\" of our budgeting.  I have not been very active recently - I guess maybe because I soaked up all the information I could years ago, and it put me on the right track.

We had separate finances for years, then got guilted into doing joint because a lot of people see separate finances as a relationship issue once married. We lasted with joint for less than two months before we went back to separate.  We've been together for almost a decade, still going strong.\n\nThe reason for doing separate isn't that we're hiding money or anything like that. It's because seeing what the other person is spending didn't add anything for us because we both trust that we are making good financial decisions. Anecdotally I've seen people who want joint accounts want them because they don't trust the other person as much so they need to check their spending. \n\nDoing joint finances did cause us to save less money and become significantly more annoyed with life because instead of being able to spend when we wanted, within our budget, we had to check in with each other every time we needed to make an unexpected purchase. We also had to keep a significantly higher amount of money in checking and not invested due to accounting for overages with spending from both of us, something we didn't have to do before. And we had to stop using credit cards and getting points and cash back, otherwise we had to do a lot more accounting to make sure we didn't go over the spending limits. \n\nThere's a huge stigma to doing separate finances which I feel is unfair. There's certainly some people who are separating or divorcing who do them because of a lack of trust, or if the partner has a spending/gambling issue, but the majority of people I know who do separate do it because it's easier. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "title": "I\u2019m getting Married!!

There is no need to feel embarrassed or guilty. Nothing about you as an awesome human being is bad or caused this financial situation.

I know it may be discouraging at first, but your budget should include all sources of income and all expenses. So please do include some groceries.\n\nNow once you have your budget and find you have more coming out than going in (spending more than you have earned in a given time period) it is time to prioritize the budget. I highly suggest paying the \u201cfour walls\u201d first. These are the basics of survival and well-being. NOTHING gets paid before these do.\n\n1. Food\n2. Shelter and utilities (lights and water)\n3. Transportation\n4. Clothing \n\nIf you can tread water by paying these, you will have a firm, secure, and healthy foundation to move on with. And from your budget, it looks like this is possible!\n\nIf this means the medical bill doesn\u2019t get paid that month, so be it. If they call and whine about it tell them you have just enough to live and eat, and you\u2019ll maybe get to them next month. Same goes for credit card. And the student loans. \n\nOnce you are stable, now it\u2019s time to look at the bigger equation. Income - outgo = what\u2019s left. That \u201cwhat\u2019s left\u201d is how you pay down the debt and save for emergencies. It\u2019s a simple equation, so either more income or less outgo is needed! I think your budget is very slim anyway, so it seems like more income is the solution!\n\nAn extra $500-$1000 dollars a month will change your life. I challenge you to find a way to make this happen! Deliver pizzas on nights and weekends, mow lawns for $20 a pop, walk dogs, whatever! With a little extra bump in your income you will get current on your bills, save an emergency fund, and blast through this debt!\n\nYou can do this, friend!

But I second someone\u2019s advice about learning what an IRA account is. \n\nIn a nutshell, it\u2019s a retirement savings account that has special tax benefits, depending if you choose to open a traditional or Roth account (but you can do both as well). In your case, since you\u2019ll likely be making much more than you do now when you retire, your target for learning at 16 will be a Roth IRA: it allows you to save up to $6,000 (2019 and onward) per year to be invested for retirement. [Try this calculator](https://www.thrivent.com/tools/calculators/roth-ira.html) to see how much money your account will have by the time you\u2019re 65 if you just save a small amount each year you work. Even if it\u2019s just a small amount of $500 a year for the next 49 years, you\u2019ll have about $200,000 saved. Because it\u2019s a Roth type of IRA account, you pay taxes on your contribution before and not after. Why does this matter? Since you\u2019ll be making what amounts to pocket money at 16 (your parents pay for your bills), you\u2019ll  pay taxes on any amount you contribute at the 12% tax bracket (unless you make over $39k this year). \n\nSo what does this all mean and why should you spend a few minutes each day this next week learning about Roth IRAs and deciding how to go about this business? Why is it a big advantage for a 16-year-old to know about? First, the sooner you start chipping in money to a retirement account, the more time it has to grow. Most people don\u2019t even begin to save for retirement until their mid to late 20s, even their 30s. You\u2019ve got a whole 10-15 years of a head start! Since you\u2019re asking about savings, you\u2019ve got a good head on your shoulders. Use it with this advantage and start chucking money in now. Second, once you pay that low 12% tax on whatever amount you contribute, you\u2019re done. No more taxes on that specific money in the history of ever. When you decide to retire and pull all that money out, it\u2019s yours outright. A Roth IRA means you pay Uncle Sam on the way in and skip on the way out\u2014all that compounding interest goes straight into your pocket. \n\nIt may seem overly mature to think about retirement, but it costs you nothing now\u2014except for a few hours of figuring out stuff out and a fewer bucks to spend on fun teenaged things in the summer and during Christmas. But you asked, my man, and it\u2019s genuinely the same advice I\u2019d have given myself 10 years ago. Good luck with it all!

Probably, you would just say you owe $5...\n\nAnyway, the difference between the \"Total Tax Due to Delaware\" and the sum of the amount you owe plus the withholdings is due to the Delaware personal credit every person receives. If you are single and under 65, that credit should be $110 as a resident. Because you aren't, you get a partial credit.

If I took one more promotion or another job interview, I could be making about 40-65k (I live in NYS so this varies).  \n\nI kept this up for two-ish years until I realized that, while the income was nice now (late teens early 20s), I did not want to work retail for the rest of my life.

I'd recommend retail if you're suited for it.  You can work your way up and make a decent living without a degree and some companies will even pay for some of your schooling if you want a business degree!  That's hand in hand with incompetent corporate offices and managers who really don't care about you.  Turn over is HIGH in retail so there are pros and cons. \n\nAnd I personally think 4 year degrees are meaningless unless you're going to use them.  I know a lot of education majors who hold a teaching degree but don't use it.  An associate degree from a community college is a lot more financially accessible and feasible!  \n\nI think you should explore all your career options and see where you want to spend the rest of your life!

What I'd do is figure out your actual breakdown and go from there. \n\nLet's say your actual breakdown over the past year has been 45/50/5. This wouldn't be terribly uncommon - if you're not paying attention, \"wants\" can easily take up too much of your overall budget. If this is actually your breakdown, then that's awesome! It means that your needs are less than the 50% advised, and since wants are inherently optional, it is theoretically easy to cut them down. Thus, conventional wisdom would say that you can easily change 45/50/5 to 45/30/25, and you'd be ahead of the game.\n\nRealistically, dropping your discretionary spending by nearly half isn't something that you can do overnight and sustain - you'll feel like you're sacrificing a lot, and for what? To see a number go up? I'd rather eat a nice meal than see some arbitrary number increase. \n\nInstead here's what I'd do:\n\n1. Assuming that your savings rate is >0%, then if you have not already, make efforts to lock in your savings. At the most basic level, set up an automatic transfer from checking to savings for the amount you can reasonably save every month. If you want to inject more discipline, change your direct deposit so that you literally don't even see the money in your paycheck. I did this for a couple years - I had $100 (all I could afford at the time) go straight into savings, and I actually had my rent direct deposited into my landlord's account when I got paid. It really made me think in about my spending in stronger terms because I didn't even consider the single largest expense in my life, and I didn't get to even think about spending that money from my check.\n2. If your breakdown indicates that needs are >50%, then challenge yourself - are they *really* needs? If so, is there any way to reduce those costs? Having needs that are too high makes you feel poor even if you're not. If you are paying too much on rent, maybe you can find a cheaper place to live when your lease expires. If you're paying too much on transportation, maybe you can reduce that cost without sacrificing too much convenience or enjoyment.\n3. Assuming that, like many of us, your wants are >30%, don't try to correct it all overnight. That's a recipe for failure. Instead, dig deeper. You'll probably find some things that you don't really care about and could do just fine without.\n4. Spend a month living without the things you don't really care about, and then reassess. Have your wants changed? Did something that you thought you really wanted last month seem less important this month? If so, then try to axe it!\n5. Once you've cut out the things you don't really care about, it's decision time. You should save for the unexpected, even if you have a healthy emergency fund, but what are you saving for, and how much do you need to save to meet your goal(s)? Is your current savings rate sufficient? If so, then what else could you use your money for? Do you have debt you want to pay down faster? That'd be a good use. \n6. If your savings rate is insufficient after cutting out things you don't really care about, then you will need to start making sacrifices. When you do that, don't go nuts. A few years ago, my wife and I were spending $500+ a month on restaurants and $300+ a month on takeout. We sat down and talked about it, and we said, \"Enough.\" We committed to spending no more than $50 on restaurants and $25 on takeout, putting the remaining $725 toward savings. The next month came, and we wound up spending $400 on restaurants and $450 on takeout. Womp womp. Our over ambitiousness cost us - we set an unrealistic goal, and once we failed to meet it, we just gave up. After that, we tried to set more reasonable goals. Restaurant spending goal was $200 and takeout was $150. *That* was attainable, and we met that goal. Our spending has crept up as our incomes have increased, but we derive so much joy from food that we have found other areas to cut from in order to meet our personal savings goals. Now, we are happy if we spend <$300 on restaurants and <$150 on takeout. Some months are better than others, but, on balance, we are right in that ballpark, and it works for us.\n\nThe short of it is, let 50/30/20 be your guide, not your prison.

Everything gets put really vertically, so a bad layout is both more common and more detrimental. If, for example, the living room is too narrow it can mean you're sitting too close to the TV.

So the question you're asking may demonstrate a lack of important knowledge.\n\nFirst you must determine an asset allocation that meets your needs. Then select funds that will provide that allocation. The allocation you choose will be the largest determining factor in your long term outcome. IOW, it's the most important decision you'll make in investing. Expenses are also of critical importance long term. Just dumping money willy-nilly into various investments is not the way to do it.\n\nBottom line... Go back to the drawing board and determine how you want to allocate your assets. This requires knowledge and study. Then select a very low cost fund (or funds, depending on how much you have to invest)) that will provide the allocation you want. I prefer to simplify my life by keeping all of my investments under one roof (Vanguard). Vanguard has a unique structure that provides some advantages, a structure that no other company has. I utilize three stock funds, two bond funds, and one money market fund (for seven figures). There are also funds of funds, which can be good for anyone, but especially those who don't have large amounts to invest and cannot meet minimum investment amounts.\n\nAnd avoid financial planners if you want to do the best you can do over the long term. This is one of those areas of your life that it's best to learn yourself. There are just too many conflicts and trap-doors in the investment management world. You'll be swimming with sharks, and you won't know you're being hosed unless you learn the ropes yourself. Furthermore, financial planners at local banks and credit unions are often quite clueless, even if you are lucky enough to trip on one who is benign in his/her intentions. It's amazing how little some of them know. Pay for tax advice from an accountant, and estate planning from a lawyer, but when it comes to selecting investments - learn enough to make your own choices.

Adds complication and doesn't need to.

At retirement you can use that money for anything.  Of course disbursements are taxable but, like a 401k, it can grow untouched by taxes for 20-30 years until you retire.\n\nSo you pay your medical bills with taxable money.  Then if you need it later you can reimburse yourself out of the HSA.  And I think there's no time requirements for the reimbursements.  So, as long as you keep good records, you can reimburse yourself 5 years down the line.  \n\nSo the HSA becomes a sort of back door emergency fund.\n\nFinally, if you lurk around the financial independence sub a while, you'll see people with their savings rate in their flair.

My spreadsheet shows we've easily made 10% in annual gains.

Not to mention the additional $50k+ we'll add to it this year. That's an easy decision in my book. \n\nHow about stopping contributions to pay the debt faster?

But I plan to play this a little differently for my child(ren) (I have one 16 month old daughter now, may have another child in the next year or two).  \n\n\n  \nS&P500 index fund is likely to beat the interest rates of most student loans. Interest on student loans doesn't start until 6 months after you graduate. Time in the market is kind (and starting balance) when investing. That S&P 500 index fund  will likely go until my kids are 30 to 40 so long after they are out of school. The plan is for them to take loans, go to school, and aggressively pay them off early (probably with some help from me) and let the S&P 500 index fund grow for those 30 or 40 years.   \n\n\nThe key points are: My kids won't get financial aid. I alone make too much. College is expensive, and my children will be pushed hard to get as much academic scholarships as possible, as many grants as possible, and work as hard as possible to get good grades. My college offered 3K per semester in grants to those who maintained deans list in their final two years. That would have amounted to a 50% discount of the final two years of my education. A LOT of money that I missed out on by being lazy just that little bit. That and most educations can start off with a lot of credits being done at community college or even in high school. Credits at my local highschool were offered for dirt cheap compared to what they cost at even the reasonably affordable college I went too. Getting a higher education can be expensive, but you can manage that cost quite well if you know how to go about it. I was the first in my family to go to college so I learned the hard way.

There is no need for a payback nor any obligation on his part. \n\nHaving said that, if my son felt like it was HIS priority and purpose to pay for his own undergrad education and told me that he was going to consider his tuition a loan and wanted to pay me back, of course I'd accept.

Assuming linear inflation (it's exponential, but close enough), that means the average value of each dollar that I pay in interest over the 30 years is ($1 + $0.55)/2 = $0.775.

She got a healthy raise and bonus that year, as recognition.\n\nIf your husband doesn't get his raise after three months, then, if I were him, I'd stick it out three more months and then start applying for jobs. The better half of a year will let him reasonably put VP on his resume, and potential future employers have no need to know his current salary - not sure what he does, so this can be off, but I can't imagine a VP-level employee earning under $125k + incentives, so if he applies elsewhere, nobody would bat an eye if he asked for $150k+ base salary.\n\nHe may need to wait to get his due, but achieving a VP title opens a LOT of doors for somebody, so this is most likely a speedbump, not a roadblock.

Then let the pro-rata rule play out.... although if you're doing a backdoor, that means you're in a high tax bracket. So I guess doing the backdoor does force you to pay high taxes on those tIRA contributions. And if you're doing a backdoor with Trad IRA money in there, then I'd imagine most people wish they could go back and just get taxed when their income was lower, so OK, I'll say if you're confident you'll do backdoor later, don't do tIRA now.

I experienced it recently with a very pushy salesman-ironically over a minivan. We cross shopped Toyota and Honda. I am a \"car guy\" and fixate on details. I normally ignore sales staff and almost always find myself much more knowledgable about their product than they are. They are simply there to fetch keys for test drives and play middle man with their \"manager\" while negotiating. We are much more of a Toyota family; I've never really liked Hondas for various reasons and my wife and her family firmly believe the Toyota brand hype. Point here was we were pre-disposed to like the Toyota van more than the Honda in several ways and the **way the sales guy treated us had such an impact on us** that we bought the Honda instead. I honestly believe it made us like the Honda van better. (It does not suck.)\n\nMoral here, sales people, if you are reading this. KNOCK THIS CRAP OFF! You are not helping yourselves.\n\nNo wonder Internet sales are taking over. Your days are numbered.\n\nI embarrassed my wife that day when I made a scene; stood up in the middle of a busy dealership and shouted at the salesman and his manager, insisting that they give me my keys back. My language was not appropriate for a family audience. While I am not proud of myself, I'm not ashamed either. Sales people like that can go to hell!\n\nI know a guy that worked in professional equipment sales for decades. He calls retail car salespeople \"**sales prevention teams**\".
