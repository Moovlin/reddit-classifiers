The two examples it gives is someone a rejecting a pro-lifer's argument because the pro-lifer is a priest, and someone rejecting a vegetarian's argument because the vegetarian is \"a sissy crybaby who loves animals way too much\".

An Ad Hominem argument happens when you attack the person, and not his/her argument according wikipedia.\n\nI literally referred to and quoted the source from wikipedia.\n\n>You have to be joking at this point.\n\nI was mostly joking because you're such an angry person and it's funny to piss you off, yes. But partially not. Here's one line I took literally from the linked page:\n\n>and the 19th century Islamic scholar Sayyid Ahmad Khan stated that \"no verse of the Quran is abrogated\".\n\nand here's another:\n\n>Ibn Al-Qayyim and Abu Amina Elias argue that what early Muslims called abrogating was actually interpretation \n\nand a third:\n\n>Some Muslim scholars (Al-Sha`rani and Shah Wali Allah) were skeptical of the use of Naskh\n\nThe point is that abrogation is not an _explicit_ part of the Quran. Heavily implied in a few verses, sure, but again that's something people can interpret differently. If they do take the majority view and interpret those verses in favor of abrogation, it still doesn't specify _which_ verses are abrogated. There is no part of the Koran that says \"Surrah a:b, m:n, and x:y no longer exist!\" Instead, someone needs to determine which parts actually contradict (and would therefore need abrogation), and which parts were just misinterpreted.\n\n>I can't help but notice how most of your points are doubting wikipedia and official sources, including DENYING the existence of actual and real Quran verses and Wikipedia articles.\n\nCan you point to where I denied the existence of any Quran verses or Wikipedia articles? I'll bet you can't.\n\n>they are 2 completely different things.\n\nSure I can. You mentioned this before, and you made the vague assertion that they can't be compared because the Quran was written by one person over a short time but the Bible was written by many people over a long time. But that's not really relevant to this conversation. Just like a Muslim reading the Quran, a Christian still needs to read the Bible, resolve any apparent contradiction, and figure out what it really means. And your assertion is hurt even more because both believe their scripture is divinely inspired. Most Christians don't believe the Bible was actually written by a bunch of different people; they believe that the Bible was written by God (who used a bunch of different people as his tools). A Christian isn't supposed to say \"Fuck it, I don't like this verse of the Bible\" any more than a Muslim is supposed to about the Quran.\n\n>unbelievebers\n\nIt's \"unbelievers\", by the way.", "title": "I\u2019m a Middle East correspondent for The Independent and I\u2019ve spent the last few years reporting on the rise and fall of the Islamic State\u2019s caliphate \u2013 ask me anything.", "num_comments": 867, "downs": 0, "author": "t2_5g353", "score": 1, "submitter": false, "ups": 1, "contro": 0}, "el0cj5s": {"body": "But he said this wasn't being sent directly to the cops.
