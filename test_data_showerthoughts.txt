But not all of it. Some of it is written in prose (ordinary writing). Hamlet, which is where the \"get thee to a nunnery\" line comes from actually has a lot of prose. I'm not sure of the break-down, but I'd guess that as much as a third of it is actually written in prose rather than verse.\n\nAs luck would have it, you're actually right to call me out in this case. In act III scene i (where the \"Get thee to a nunnery\" lines appear), Hamlet starts out speaking in verse. This is where we get \"To be, or not to be\", which is one of the most highly regarded use of verse in the English language (you'll make a lot of nerds mad if you claim this isn't poetry). However, throughout Hamlet we see speaking in prose used as an indicator of madness. As this scene continues, Hamlet is either going mad or pretending to (depending on your interpretation) and begins speaking in prose.\n\nBy the time we reach Hamlet's two \"Get thee to a nunnery\" lines, he's clearly speaking in prose. Strictly speaking, this means that the syllable count isn't fundamental to the writing. I made my comment as a joke, rather than as a correction. But you're right to suggest the syllables don't matter here, even if you'd have been wrong in most of Shakespeare. Kudos.\n\nOf course, since you made me think about this harder than I'd originally intended, I went to see if \"Begone thot\" actually does work in place of \"Get thee to a nunnery\" in these lines.\n\nIn the first speech:\n\n>**Get thee to a nunnery**: why wouldst thou be a\nbreeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;\nbut yet I could accuse me of such things that it\nwere better my mother had not borne me: I am very\nproud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at\nmy beck than I have thoughts to put them in,\nimagination to give them shape, or time to act them\nin. What should such fellows as I do crawling\nbetween earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,\nall; believe none of us. **Go thy ways to a nunnery**.\nWhere's your father?\n\nI think that it works surprisingly well. We lose a little pseudo-rhyming between \"nunn**er**y\", \"breed**er**\" and \"sinn**er**s\" off the top, but \"Begone thot\" is so forceful in itself that is may strengthen the forcefulness of the line. We lose some of the manic flavour of the line, but it generally works. At the end, we again lose the pseudo-rhyme between \"nunn**er**y\" and \"fath**er*\", but I've always liked those lines best when performed as completely separate thoughts. Where he's manic, then calmly asks for the location of Ophelia's father. Some academic's going to come along and shoot me for saying so, but I actually think I like the substitution of \"Begone thot\" *better* in this location.\n\nWe have less luck in the second speech:\n\n>If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for\nthy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as\nsnow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a\nnunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs\nmarry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough\nwhat monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,\nand quickly too. Farewell.\n\nDespite this still being in prose, we've got some real rhymes in here; \"marry\", \"dowry\", \"calumny\", the build-up these words give us has no pay-off without \"nunnery\". And the extra forcefulness available from \"Begone thot\" does nothing to mend this buried in the middle of the speech. It simply squanders the potential of this speech, and offers nothing in exchange. And, I guess, if this speech is going to say \"nunnery\", we ought to leave the first one saying \"nunnery\" too.\n\nI tried, but I'm afraid we can't improve Shakespeare with this particular change here. And, honestly, if we want to try and improve Shakespeare, we're probably setting our sights a little high by starting with Hamlet.

I know right, pretty surprising. I'll answer both questions! The 2006 trial was a prospective study done with 8000 women taking part in maternity units in Belgium and France (this bit of info is important because in 2001-2002 when the study took place women delivering breech babies vaginally was standard practice). This study also discussed critical management differences between the two populations, like pelvimetry and fetal heart rate monitoring. The findings showed no difference between the two groups in individual severe adverse outcomes. They also showed a very small increase in risk for the neonate in vaginal breech births, but nothing compared to the 2000 Hannah et al trial, and not enough to routinely offer c-sections to all breech mothers. The authors of the 2006 trial put down these results to proper fetal monitoring, strict selection criteria (i.e. no other risk factors) and management guidelines. \n\nAs for your second question - breech babies are automatically much more at risk compared to non-breech babies, regardless of method of birth. Perinatal mortality is increased 2 to 4 fold for breech babies. This is down to many reasons, but death of the neonate is mostly down to malformations (which could explain why the baby was breech in the first place), prematurity and death in utero. The risk factors for breech babies are: prematurity, uterine malformations, placenta previa, multiple babies, fetal abnormality and poly/oligohydramnious (not enough or too much amniotic fluid). So the increase in risk factors for breech compared to non-breech isn't necessarily the position itself, but rather the reasons behind the position.

Until a doctor published a paper that stated that outcomes for babies were more favourable in a c-section delivery if they were breech, which pretty much changed practice overnight (autism-MMR link flashbacks anyone?). Turns out this paper was not reliable and the data was incorrect, but the damage had already been done. The majority of breech babies are born via c-section, which has de-skilled practitioners who rarely see a breech baby. So it's become a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts, because NOW it has become slightly more high risk as the practitioners training is rarely put into practice. But at the end of the day, c-sections don't mean the baby doesn't come out breech, it still comes out butt first, and the risks to baby are actually the same, just with increase risk to the mother with complications that arise from a serious surgery. I've delivered multiple breech babies vaginally and it doesn't phase me one bit. Despite presenting the facts to breech-mothers and assuring them that I have plenty of experience, most still go for a c-section because of this ingrained fear that society has of breech babies. Which is fine, I obviously support them with whatever they want to do!

To highlight this, two new Eeveelutions were added: the psychic type Espeon and the dark type Umbreon. Eevee evolves into Espeon when leveled up with high enough friendship during the day, and into Umbreon at night.\n\nGeneration 4 (Diamond/Pearl) introduced two further Eeveelutions to bring the total to seven. Eevee evolves into the grass type Leafeon when leveled up in an area containing a Moss Stone, and into the ice type Glaceon in an area with an Ice Stone.\n\nIn Generation 6 (X/Y), the fairy type was added, as well as new minigame that allows you to pet, feed, and play with your Pok\u00e9mon to raise an invisible stat called Affection. To expand on these, the fairy type Sylveon was introduced, which evolves from Eevee when leveled up while knowing a fairy-type move and having a high enough Affection.\n\nAs you can see, new Eeveelutions have in the past been added every odd-numbered generation.
