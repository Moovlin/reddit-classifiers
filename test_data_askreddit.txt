However, there were multiple reports from pilots of sudden events where the nose got pushed down in situations where it didn't warrant it. Thankfully most pilots knew about this system and knew to either disable it or work around it. \n\nThe other part is 737 MAX ship by default with one AoA sensor, with a second sensor and an on-screen display noting when these sensors disagree as a paid upgrade. Neither plane that crashed had this paid upgrade installed. \n\nPart of Boeing's proposed fixes to the 737 MAX include adding a second AoA sensor and the AoA disagree software.

If you pay off the full balance for Jan anytime in Feb, you won't owe any interest, and the credit companies will see that you can pay off the bills that you accrue. If you don't pay off the full balance, just the minimum payment or half of the bill or whatever, then the portion you didn't pay off will carryover into the next month, and you will owe that balance, plus interest, plus the balance for that next month.

Usually 5 or 6 different books at any one time (hardback, paperback, big \"doorstops\" and tiny novellas hardly larger than a pamphlet. All neatly stacked underneath one thin pillow.\n\nNow being in the top bunk I also didn't have easy access to the lightswitch so my parents got me a small halogen spotlight that had a long cable and a clamp to attach it to the bedframe.\n\nSo to recap: I slept on a pillow on top of a slab of books wrapped up in a duvet on a mostly fabric mattress in an almost entirely wooden bedframe with a small but bright lamp which heated up very quickly. This was the real life equivalent of videogame characters using oil drums as cover.\n\nSo the inevitable happened and one night I fell asleep without turning off my reading light. I woke up a few hours later after feeling an uncomfortable heat against my cheek. While I was asleep the lamps adjustable stand had come loose and slowly slumped forward until it was pressed into the pillow. By the time I had woken up the lamp had already burned straight through one side of my pillow and out the other and had begun to char the Horrible Histories magazines directly beneath.\n\nNaturally I calmly turned off and moved the light before sheepishly going to my parents to explain what had happened and ask for a replacement pillow.

When the estimate for a satellite is (say) 180 days, that's assuming worst-case: multiple primary systems fail, and the vehicle needs to keep going. Materials that will last beyond the required lifetime are used to maximize the possibility of success. This is why a satellite doesn't cost $29.95, but several million bucks.\n\n\\- The engineers who command and work with the equipment do things like build systems that queue up many orbits' worth of observations, then optimize the use of the attitude control to minimize the propellant used. They know the machines inside and out so well that when something fails, they can use a different strategy to continue the mission, usually performing at less than the optimum. Galileo had really bad luck with its tape recorder, which required measures such as declaring a section of tape unusable and working the around that limit, and the weird electronics bugs caused by the environment around Jupiter. Most people using a piece of consumer electronics would have tossed it.\n\n>it was determined that the cause of the malfunction was a reduction of light output in three infrared Optek OP133 light-emitting diodes located in the drive electronics of the recorder's motor encoder wheel. The GaAs LEDs had been particularly sensitive to proton-irradiation-induced atomic lattice displacement defects, which greatly decreased their effective light output and caused the drive motor's electronics to falsely believe the motor encoder wheel was incorrectly positioned. *Galileo*'s flight team then began a series of \"annealing\" sessions, where current was passed through the LEDs for hours at a time to heat them to a point where some of the crystalline lattice defects would be shifted back into place, thus increasing the LED's light output. After about 100 hours of annealing and playback cycles, the recorder was able to operate for up to an hour at a time. After many subsequent playback and cooling cycles, the complete transmission back to Earth of all recorded Amalthea flyby data was successful.\n\n\\- Sometimes, despite everything, it doesn't work out. Mars Observer went silent halfway to Mars. No one knows why. Best guess is that it blew up trying to do the trans-Mars insertion.

Another problem with \"positive properties\" just immediately, off the top of my head, what if two of those were mutually exclusive? Let's say \"sexuallya attractive to hetero men\" and \"sexually attractive to hetero women\" are positive properties. Any God-like being would have to be both, and generally speaking those two groups won't feel much attraction toward what the other prefers.

Swollen lymph nodes can be a sign.  Compromised immune system (i.e getting sick all the time) can be a sign.  \n\nThe problem with many of these signs is they can also indicate a ton of other moderate to severe issues unrelated to cancer.  \n\nBest thing you can do: annual checkups with a primary; Have routine hematology and chemistry labs drawn; Understand your family history (if possible).  Example: If you are female and you mother developed breast cancer early (30's or 40's is considered early).  Odds are you are at risk to develop something as well.  Also, knowing your own risks due to race and lifestyle are important.  African American men are more likely to develop prostate cancer than caucasians.  Smokers are more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers.  It is important to work with your doctor to ensure you are proactively looking for things.
