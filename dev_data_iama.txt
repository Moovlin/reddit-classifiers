Are they not real Muslims? And just because there's a passage that supports your claim, later passages override earlier passages, and the later half of the Qur'an is far more bloody and backwards than the first. Give me a passage saying it's wrong and I can provide you one which says it's just fine.\n\nDid you get your entire idea of Islam from the Guardian? Where every Muslim who isn't completely benign is declared not a Muslim, therefore Islam is all sunshine and rainbows? Would you do the same with Christianity?\n\n> Americans engage in extensive domestic abuse as I highlighted with ACTUAL STATISTICS\n\nNo, you have claimed it's at endemic levels with a couple of statistics which are far below the global average. I've never seen a study which puts the number of women who have suffered domestic abuse in Pakistan at less than 50%. Some go as high as 80%. Can you not compare the two, and say one is better? If you say you beat your wife in the UK you will get filled in, but when it's literally more than 2/3 of the population that obviously isn't the case.\n\n> racist feelings based on movies\n\nSorry? I honestly don't get this at all, and I'll put it down to just wanting to use the word racist again. You do you brother.\n\n> Maybe you're delusional and racist\n\nIslam isn't a race, and it's rather rich you calling me delusional while claiming the west is worse for women than the Islamic world. Get some perspective.\n\n> Read a book.\n\nThanks Cenk, knock down argument right there.\nStop reading only far-left intersectional propaganda and come back to the real world. Hell, I'm pretty sure I can articulate the intersectional world view better than you can, and I think it's all horseshit. It's called engaging with ideas you disagree with, you should try it sometime, rather than trying to smear anyone you disagree with as racist.\n\nRead more than your current single viewpoint and you may learn something.", "title": "I\u2019m a Middle East correspondent for The Independent and I\u2019ve spent the last few years reporting on the rise and fall of the Islamic State\u2019s caliphate \u2013 ask me anything.", "num_comments": 867, "downs": 0, "author": "t2_15p34b", "score": 1, "submitter": false, "ups": 1, "contro": 0}, "el0m5qo": {"body": "one of my friends is left handed and plays games a lot, i have literally never heard him say it\u2019s harder for him or anything.
