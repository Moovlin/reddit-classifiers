She said it doesn\u2019t really work like that, that they have an aid you can apply for based on income and such. I showed her my 2018 tax form and she said that she would expect the bill to be cut to 10k. I paid the 8k that day and she said if the bill was reduced below the 8k based on aid I would get whatever difference back. Yeah right. Why would they hand me money I obviously had and already paid them.\n\nTwo days ago I got approved for aid, bill was cut to $5569. I\u2019ve got $2431 on it\u2019s way back to me.

This frees up the balance sheets of the primary market, allowing lenders to continue to write loans for customers because they have their assets capitalized appropriately.

Assuming she took 4 weeks of vacation/holiday time as you've stated, that works out to an average of about 33hrs a week. If she were to arrive at exactly 9 and leave at exactly 5 every day m-f that's 35hrs a week, so my guess is 9-5 is her actual work schedule and there were on average a couple hours a week that amounted to small bits of time off here and there (appointments, leaving early at slow times, etc.) and just added up over the year. I think the miscalculation is assuming that salary = 40hrs/week, because that doesn't look like what she actually works. Most labor regulations require hourly workers to get a lunch and breaks for certain amounts of time worked, so if she is actually working 9-5 then that's almost certainly 35 not 40 hours a week. \n\nIf it were me I'd go in and ask for the difference between what she did work last year and what that would be ($3360, so maybe ask for $58,000 or start at an even $60k). I'd also ask to get 3 or 4 weeks PTO not \"$3800\" whatever that means, and get them to put in writing what happens to remaining PTO at the end of the year. Does she lose it, carry it to next year, get it paid out, and what happens if she's let go? I've worked a number of salary positions and I've never seen an offer for PTO in dollars, which makes no sense for a salaried worker. Is that 4 weeks at $24/hr, or 3 weeks at $32, if she doesn't take any does she just get a check for $3800 on Dec 31st? That's the only part of their offer that seems truly suspect to me. \n\nAs far as the \"oh no salary means she'll be working *waaay* more hours\" that you're bound to get from everyone (many who've probably never worked salaried in their life) it's purely speculation. With 3 co-workers I think she should have a good idea of how much she will be expected to work in the foreseeable future. There's only 3 other people, so if they downsize or if they start to really take off are the only realistic reason her workload would shift dramatically. In either of those cases she'd have reason to argue for more (or that they need to hire someone else to take up the slack) along with a point about where the money would come from.\n\nAlso, as small, young, and close nit as this company sounds like it must be, if you go in asking for almost $20k more than she actually made last year you're probably asking for way more than they can even afford. For all you know they're doing this to try and make sure they can get by a few more years without having to let her or her one (non-owner) co-worker go. Why speed up that process if you were OK on what she made last year? If the money is that important, it sounds like you have an idea that she could make more elsewhere. However, if she likes this company, and working with these people, is it worth the extra money to jump ship and work for some bigger company where there's a good chance she'll be treated much more like a cog than a colleague and fellow founder?

Or a mixture of them? Or, is there a strain on your relationship with your fiancee or desire for work-life balance in general? You need to first identify the cause of the stress and see if you can fix that...\n\n* Distance - can you move closer? Or maybe you hate your car and want something which uses less gas.\n* No breaks - is this poor time management? Book yourself breaks or lunch to guarantee a break AND take it, a coworker gave me that idea many years ago and it has been very useful.\n* Nature of the job position - are you bored and unchallenged or is it too challenging due to lack of experience (not knocking you at all), is there training you can take or are you able to talk to your manager?\n* Nature of your job career - what are you interested in? Are there options at your current employer to move into a position of interest? Do you need more education for what you are interested in?\n\nIt sounds like money isn't causing any stress - which is great. But if you do switch career paths and start at the bottom can you handle the change in finances? At age 38 I switch from IT making $90K to accounting making $50K, even when mentally and financially prepared for it, it was still a bit of a mind shock. Perhaps stick it out for a year or two while you get the education/training for your next career path, you might as well earn more money while paying for education for new career - this is what I did before finalizing my switch from IT to accounting.\n\nAs for losing the after-tax retirement plan, it can be a bummer, but if everything else is causing stress it's not worth it. Plus, if you then only have a traditional 401k (or 403b or whatever), you still have the option to contribute to a Roth IRA, it doesn't have as high of a contribution ceiling, but it's still something.\n\nAs for the medical, dental, and similar benefits, most companies actually provide these, and what about your future bride's benefits? You can always become a dependent on her plan - my wife and I switched from her being on my benefits to me being on her benefits many years ago due to the details/costs of the plans, and we review options from both of our employers every time they come up in the event of changes in plans or our medical situation - e.g. planning to do LASIK, new prescriptions, plan cost of prescriptions, planning to have or adopt a child, costs, etc.\n\n$3,000 pension? Is that missing a \"0\" or two because that's less than one month's pay for you or is that just what it has accrued to at this point? I believe they have two options: maintain the account until you hit retirement age or offer to pay it out. They generally want to pay it out to get the obligation off their books - pensions are notoriously over-promised and end up costing more than planned.

I have two major holdings in my portfolio that generate monthly revenue in the form of dividend payments\n\nSWAGX is a Charles Schwab aggragate bond fund.  It buys bonds from across the market.   This fund pays $0.02 cents per share with shares costing $10 (roughly).   \n\nI would need 50 shares valued at $500 to make $1/mo.   Now let's say my goal is to have a new share purchased through dividend reinvestment each month (a fair starter goal), I would need a $5000 stake to pay me $10/month.   Now add zeros, a $50,000 stake gets me $100/month, a $500,000 stake gets me $1000/month.   So you can see I would need A LOT of money just to live monthly off of this bond fund.  \n\nNow bonds are not the best way to make money, they are mainly there to protect principle and help investors earn more money than in a savings account, so let's look at my other favorite dividend fund.\n\nSPHD is a high dividend ETF that pays monthly.   Shares cost around $42 with a $0.14 pay rate.   10 shares of SPHD pay around $1.40 and are valued at $420.   You'd need around 325 shares to hit that magic \"each month your dividends are buying a new share\" ratio.   325 x 42 = $13,650.   Now add zeros again $136,500 = $420/mo, $1,365,000 = $4200/mo.   \n\nSo assuming all are equal and the fund never loses value and continues to pay out the same, you'd need a cool $1.3 mil just to be drawing a reasonable paycheck.    \n\nThis is why we encourage growing your money in index funds while you are still working.   If you grow that money as a young worker then you can move it into these dividend paying assets as you reach retirement age.      That said, it doesn't hurt to have a mixed range of assets in your portfolio.    My portfolio is mainly comprised of my bond fund, my index fund, and an international fund.    The last two grow the bulk of my money while the bond fund ticks away earning some beer money for me while protecting the balance I put in.   SPHD is something I invest in on a whim, it gives me a little extra play money per month now.   But it, or a fund like it, is something I'll be counting on in retirement age.

I would avoid CapitalOne simply because unlike Ally, Alliant and Discover, CapitalOne requires a minimum $10K balance to get their higher tiered interest in their money market account.\n\nBetween the latter three, all are good but I prefer Ally or Alliant more because both offer ATM Fee reimbursement while Discover does not.  Between Ally and Alliant, I prefer Alliant because they offer $20 vs $10 in reimbursement and have a larger free to use ATM network\u2014using both Allpoint and the CO-OP network of credit unions, while Ally only uses Allpoint.  Because Alliant is part of the CO-OP network, if the ATM accepts deposits, you can also deposit cash and checks directly.  If you tried to deposit cash at Ally or Discover, you\u2019d need to either buy money orders in cash first and deposit that through mobile check deposit or you\u2019d need to use a second local bank and then ACH transfer.  Another perk is Alliamt offers .65% interest in checking if you make a single deposit each month.  In contrast, Discover offers nothing and Ally offers .10% or .60% with balances of $15K or more.\n\nAs for credit, I wouldn\u2019t pick a single bank or credit card just to consolidate them all.  I would pick the best card or bank and keep them separate.  With that being said, Alliant does offer an excellent no fee 2% cashback card.  They also have a preferred version with an annual fee that offers 3.5% cashback for the first year (and waives the annual fee the first year) and drops the cashback to 2.5%.  To avoid the fee, you can always do a product change to the no fee 2% before the end of the the first year.\n\nAlso one thing to note about Discover is that their debit card offers 1% cashback on up to $3000 per statement period.  Not too useful with 2% or better cashback credit cards, but I\u2019ve found a use for it when paying my federal estimated taxes which charges a fee of 1.87% if I use credit but only charges $2.55 if I use debit.  As such I accumulate around $120/year or more in cashback.\n\nIf you travel a lot, consider getting a Schwab checking account.

First let\u2019s start by what retirement really is:  the financial situation in which your savings and government benefits are enough to fund the rest of your life without working again.  To be clear, retirement is not an age and it doesn\u2019t just happen when you can\u2019t work any longer.  Or, if you haven\u2019t saved at all you will have to live off of OAS, CPP, and potentially GIS.  You won\u2019t starve in the streets but you may give up a lot of freedom and flexibility in retirement if you don\u2019t have any of your own savings.  \n\nHow to prioritize:  first take advantage of any employer match you can get.  That is free money which you are throwing away every time you don\u2019t contribute enough to get the match.  \n\nSecond: pay off any high interest debt.  It sounds like you are paying extra toward your cc, but not paying it off in full every month.  You will want to cut your regular spending or increase income to the pint that you no longer carry a revolving credit card balance, because paying interest on a cc is a huge waste of money.  Only use your cc when you have money in the bank to pay it off.  \n\nNext establish a 3-6 month emergency fund so you have sufficient savings to not go into debt again.  In your case it would be best to open a high interest savings account in each of your TFSAs so you can get 2.5%+ interest and not pay taxes on that amount.  \n\nFinally, you will want to set aside additional savings for retirement.  I know this is daunting, but you should be trying to save 20% or more of your take home pay, especially since you haven\u2019t saved so far.  You won\u2019t be able to do that all at once, but don\u2019t get discouraged and do nothing.

I see 2-2.5% advertised  from a few different places online. \n\n* Use 10-15k at a time to harvest new savings account bonuses from the banks that offer them. Typically the terms look like \"put 10k in, leave it 90 days, we give you $500, it's insured\" kind of thing. If you do this kind of churning shortly before taking out a mortgage, don't be surprised if the mortgage company asks you to do a bit more explaining to prove the money is really yours and not a loan from someone else. \n\n* Consider CDs for the money that's earmarked for future years of medical school. Depending on what rates they have you might be able to get a better return than a savings account. \n\nAnd finally, if you're planning to live in the house you buy for more than 5-10 years, look do the math on whether the interest rate reduction due to a larger down payment would be worth it for you.

You really need to do this at Ally since checking pays basically nothing and the savings pays great.  What I really wanted was 1 checking account that pays a rate somewhere in between the two at Ally.\n\nI found this at NBKC Bank after looking around pretty hard.  They pay 1% for their checking account, no matter the balance.  I know I won't be getting 2% like some savings accounts, but I won't be getting .1% on my checking money then either.  It is half way in between and I don't have to mess with moving money around each month.  First box of checks is free, not sure of the next.  No fees or hassles that I have found.  They return 12 dollars of ATM fees each month.  I really like them so far and have no complaints.\n\nThe best thing for me is that they actually have 4 physical branches in Kansas City and I only live 5 hours from there.  That sealed the deal for me; knowing that I can stop in if need be.  I did actually stop in while passing through last month just to put my mind at ease(I am/was a bit hesitant about online only banking).\n\nGood luck.  I just wanted to give NBKC a plug since I don't see it mentioned much.  And they are a good option for those who don't want to shift money around all the time.

He gets $800 on a normal week.\n\nSame person decides to work 10 hours overtime, and gets 40 * 20 + 10 * 30 in such a week. He gets $1100 on an overtime week.\n\nThe way withholding works, on a normal paycheck, the system thinks his annual income is 800 * 52, and amount of withholding if Single-2 would be about 64. He might think, \"I'm getting taxed 64/800, which is 8%.\"\n\nOn an overtime paycheck, the system thinks his annual income is 1100 * 52, and amount of withholding if Single-2 would be about 111. He might think, \"I'm getting taxed 111/1100, which is 10%.\"\n\nThat is the source of the misconception.\n\nNow let's see what the reality is. It WILL be true that your overall effective tax is higher if your income is higher. So someone with NO overtime will have one effective tax rate, and someone with SOME overtime will have a higher effective tax rate. That's simply because in our system as your income goes up, your effective tax goes up. But the amount it goes up is not at all the 2% leap that your coworkers are focusing on.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose in the course of a year, person has 44 normal weeks at $800 and 8 overtime weeks at $1100. What is their overall tax rate?\n\nincome = 44 * 800 + 8 * 1100 = 44000\n\nincome tax = 3624\n\neffective rate = 8.2%\n\nSo instead of effective tax rate of 8%, their effective rate is 8.2%. Not 10%.\n\nWhat happens is they get a refund of overwithholding.\n\nIn the above example, if their withholding would be 44 * 64 + 8 * 111 = 3704. But their tax is only 3624, so they get a refund of $80. This is a part of their \"take-home\" that they forget to take into account, because they don't see it until after tax filing and they probably don't do the overall math to look at their effective tax rate.

This is why you don't buy based on payment alone.  Car salespeople have a scheme (scam) that they use called a four square.  They use it to put people in too much car.\n\nWork backwards with your bank starting with your desired payment and term (important) to determine how much car you can afford.  Then shop within that number, as much under it as you can bear.\n\nIdeally, we should only buy what we can afford on 3 year plan with the lowest possible interest rate.  So 454 payment for 3 years at 2% rate would allow 16k.  \n\nUse a [TVM Calculator](http://www.zenwealth.com/businessfinanceonline/TVM/TVMCalculator.html) to calculate it yourself.  I put in 454 for payment, 0.1666 for interest rate (2%/12), 36 periods, monthly, and clicked the PV button.\n\nSince this is less than a new compact base model, that means you can't afford a new car.  So, you take the 454 per month and put it into a savings account every month, and network to find a used car.  What you're looking for is a grandmother who passed away and her family wants to sell the car, or a someone who is upgrading after 10 years and is being offered next to nothing for their trade-in, and is willing to sell below KBB but wants to do so now.

Ideally the child should be included in the discussion and have a say, especially in this case where u/Veptaa mentioned they had money in their savings that they could have used instead, allowing them to keep the coin.\n\nBut I can also understand why a parent would choose not to. It could be that they feel their child is simply too young to really understand either the predicament or its ramifications, or that it's their job as parents to deal with these issues without putting any stress onto their children, or worry that the child will say \"no\" and put them in a position where they either have to try to find some other method of coming up with money or ignore their child's wishes and upset them and make the whole situation worse.\n\nNot to say that any of those above situations makes it \"okay\" for the parent to do it, but my point is that saying \"any parent who does this type of thing without telling their child is fucked up\" is way too general and there are other factors that need to be considered. If they honestly believe that they are doing the best thing for the child by preventing them from being upset at losing something while simultaneously making sure they still have food to eat and a roof over their head, it may be a shitty situation for everyone to be in, but I would hardly call that fucked up.\n\nConversely, if they were doing it to buy toys for themselves, or make a payment on a car they simply cannot afford, or drugs/alcohol or whatever, something that ultimately does not serve the interests of the child, then yes, I would absolutely call that fucked up.\n\nIntent and motivation do absolutely matter, and while the end result might be the same once the child finds out (in that they've lost a possession), the reasoning behind that original decision should serve as either mitigation or exacerbation for the child's anger. It's not very fair to good parents to say that someone who chose to make that difficult decision to help their child is \"exactly as fucked up\" as someone who did it for their own benefit to the detriment of their child.\n\nI can't really comment on Veptaa's case, though I lean more towards the \"fucked up\" side due to the points you raised and further comments by them. But I don't like this idea of generalizing to all situations - parenting is not easy and it requires making difficult decisions a lot. Those decisions may not always be the best objectively, but if the parent tried their best and was honestly trying to give them the best life with the least hardship, I think it's considerably more forgivable.

My grandfather gave all his grandchildren stock in a company.  I'd check the stock all the time in the late 90s when I was a teen.  At one point it got up to $10,000.  Eventually my dad admitted he had sold it years ago and intended to pay it back, but didn't expect it to get as high as it did (he never paid it back).\n\nHe also would straight up take money my grandmother sent me for Christmas.  I think he justified this, because they were his parents.  \n\nBut the Grandmother from my mom's side also agreed to pay my for my braces - so she started sending checks too.   He paid them at first, but started slipping behind in his bills.  Eventually, I learned he was just cashing them and not paying the orthodontist.  Luckily I was like 14 years old at the time and the Orthodontist continued with my treatment in-spite of my dad being a deadbeat.  \n\nHe did once open up a cable bill in my name too and slipped on a couple payments that I became aware of when I was trying to get a car loan when I was 19.  \n\nYeah.  Kinda shitty.  I love him, but at some point I took a firm stance that money would never play a part in our relationship ever again.  He's always broke and lives paycheck to paycheck, but it's his own fault.  It's a lifestyle problem that he's been able to get away with for decades, because his parents would often bail him out.  He's a real estate agent, but he'd make some money, take a few months off, and be broke - constantly crying about how some deal fell through, because someone \"fucked him over\".  It was also frustrating to me that the guy was severely overweight, smoked cigarettes in spite of a heart condition, and I had heard whispers he spent a lot of time playing poker.  I kept telling him to get his shit together, but he wouldn't listen to me, because I'm his son.\n\nAbout 6 years ago around December he claimed he needed $50 for gas, because business was slow during the Holidays.  I gave him a $50 gas card - and he was pretty pissed about it.   That was the last straw for me.  I told him I loved him, but I would never be giving him money again.  I gladly took him skiing (and paid for it), told him I'd be happy to take him to restaurants (and pay for it), and was even willing to take him out to ball games (and pay for it), but... no cash.  Never.   So next Christmas comes around, he cries poverty again... I don't give him any money.  He flips out and we don't talk for 5 months.   Next Christmas, same thing.  No money, he flips out... we don't talk for 6 months.   Next Christmas, he actually tried to give me $200... I gave it back to him and said, \"stick this shit on your fridge with a note... and next time you think about asking me for money, take that instead.\"   \n\nSome time after that, he had another predictable health issue, couldn't work for a couple months... and came to me asking for $50.   I again refused.   It's a matter of principle at this point.  Yeah, it sucked that he got sick, but I've been warning him about it for years.  Also, I know he has other friends he can go to who will help him out.   Nonetheless, he took it as the ultimate betrayal that I refused to help him out.  He tells everyone I'm the devil.  The worst son in the world. Abandoned him in his time of need.  He flings every possible disgusting insult towards me you can imagine - including insulting my wife with racial slurs (though she has nothing to do with it)... all the while, he keeps demanding an apology and trying to convince me it's my fault we're estranged.  We haven't seen each other in a year. \n\nI love the guy, but he's a shit-show with a victim complex and I've made peace with the fact at some point I'm going to get a call he's gone.  \n\n...

You can only choose mileage or actual expenses, but not both. Mileage may very well be the best choice, but then that disqualifies any deductions of actual vehicle expenses like your property tax, oil changes, gas, or anything like that. or the opposite may be true. Your actual expenses may be greater than the mileage deduction would have been, but then you wouldn\u2019t get a deduction for the mileage. The software will let you enter everything and then will either have you choose which method you want to use for vehicle expenses or will let you choose, I can\u2019t remember off the top of my head.\n\nAn itemized deduction is something any and every taxpayer can take, if they have them. Every taxpayer will take either the standard deduction or itemized deductions, whichever is greater in their case. \n\nOn the other hand, business expenses on Schedule C are only for people who have self-employment income or are independent contractors. If someone is an employee of a business and receives wages with federal tax withheld from their checks, along with social security and Medicare withheld, then they are considered an employee for tax purposes. At tax time, they receive a W-2 and their wages and withholding are reported on the main tax form, Form 1040. They are not considered to have self-employment income and they do not complete Schedule C. \n\nIf someone is a contractor or freelancer and is paid with no federal tax or Social Security or Medicare withheld, they are considered an independent contractor for tax purposes. At tax time, they may receive a 1099-misc with their earnings (they may not, and may have to just use their records to report their income) and this is self-employment income and is reported on Schedule C. They can then offset their self-employment income with business expenses they paid throughout the year.\n\nSo anyone (employee or contractor) can itemize their deductions if they have expenses in those categories (home mortgage interest, medical expenses, property tax, charitable contributions).\n\nBut only those with self-employment income use Schedule C and take the business related deductions.\n\nI know this is a novel already but sometimes you have to choose where to take your deduction that will give you the best bang for your buck. With some expenses, you have options. One scenario is that it makes more sense to choose the mileage method for your business expenses, and so you can\u2019t use that property tax there since it\u2019s an actual expense. So instead you use it as an itemized deduction. Another scenario is that all your itemized deductions add up to less than the amount of the standard deduction. So you take the standard deduction and then use the property tax as a business expense, if you choose the actual expense method for your vehicle expenses. A third scenario is that the mileage method makes more sense and you take the standard deduction, so you end up not using that property tax at all. OR maybe you use the actual expenses method for vehicle expenses, and your itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction, so you use the business percentage of the property tax as a business vehicle expense, and use the rest as an itemized expense.

People prepay for a variety of reasons (move, lose job, die, divorce, etc.). Banks fund these loans with deposits, on which it pays substantially lower rates. As the yield curve shifts and twists, profitably on holding loans evolves, and isn't as simple as earning a spread over inflation. Also, profitability changes whether someone prepays or pays the loan off over the contractual term based on the evolution of market rates, the risk of which is priced into the loan rate.

That\u2019s huge!\n\nYou need to make a plan to work out of debt ASAP so you can implement this plan to allow yourself to save for retirement since you are already behind.  Get the budget, pay down debt, and don\u2019t accumulate debt.   Your budget needs to be focused on funneling additional money to debts.  In my opinion, you don\u2019t have money for even an annual vacation until you are out of debt.  You may feel otherwise, but each vacation you take will add time for you to get out of debt.  The longer it takes to get out of debt, the longer until you really start winning at retirement, and the longer you will need to work.  Is that worth your vacation?\n\nDo the hard work of getting out of debt and in the interim start learning about investing.  I was 27 and read Dave Ramsey\u2019s Total Money Makeover and it changed my outlook on finances.  His advice is solid (a little preachy though) for someone beginning to learn about investing.  You will learn how to manage and invest money.  The book makes you inspired and want to get out of debt.\n  ", "title": "Retirement question for two 40 year old married Canadians with no clue lol", "num_comments": 4, "downs": 0, "author": "t2_2mwydn90", "score": 1, "submitter": false, "ups": 1, "contro": 0}, "ejo1ayb": {"body": "Your husband has been constantly promoted and given raises.

This is the most important aspect.  \n\nThe effect of utilization is temporary.  If you go over 30% or so, it drops your score down, but as soon as you pay it down, that part returns immediately.  Though carrying more on the card than you can pay off in a month definitely affects what's important.  Net worth.\n\nIncreasing credit score is good for what purpose?  Carrying a debt absorbing 30% of your income, or more?  I'm not saying having a good credit score is bad, but your advice has OP borrowing to buy a house AND a car.  For what purpose?  For reasons I don't understand, employers are starting to run credit reports on prospective employees.  And you need credit report to lease a house or apartment, that I understand.  And some financial institutions want one before opening a checking account.  These are all checks on your credit report, not the score.  (Well the checking thing may have a score associated). They're looking for late payment history or excessive debt loads.  Beyond these, the uses of the credit score are to secure credit.  In this country too many people carry more debt than they can afford, and it keeps us living paycheck to paycheck.  30% debt payment to income ratio is acceptable!  Or more!  Of that 30%, 10% or more is interest.  So we pay taxes and health insurance and take home 80% of our income.  30% goes to debt.  Leaving 50%, out of which to pay living expenses and save for retirement.\n\nIf you save 20% for retirement, and 10% for savings goals (car and downpayment for a house if you elect to go that direction), and you start this at 24, you can absolutely have enough saved to pay your expenses for the rest of your life by 50.  Saving to reach FI, by raising your saving rate, you are also lowering your expenses.  So if you make 30k, and you manage to save 6k per year for 25 years and average 8% ROR, you'll build almost 440k.  And your cost of living is 24k.  440k will produce 35k per year if you continue averaging 8% ROR.  (8% is conservative 11% market average yearly return over any window > 10 years, minus 3% for inflation).  If you define living on 80% of your net income as living within your means, then you can absolutely retire by 50.  You also have to plan to not expand your cost of living when you retire.\n\nI learned all of this through having subterranean credit scores and digging out from debt.  Took more than 6 months, but I'm 700+, and the end of the consumer debt is visible...before the end of this year.  And by looking, far too late, at what I needed to do to step out of the rat race.  For me to get that 25 year window of savings, I need to work until I'm past retirement age.  So I'm working to do as much as I can until then, and hoping social security has enough left in it to help me some.\n\nOP doesn't have any debt.  Didn't you see that part?  OP probably already has a 700 credit score.  I'd like to see their scores as calculated by Experian and Transamerica.  By focusing on Net Worth instead of credit score, though continuing to pay bills on time, OP will be able to pay cash for a car, and if they decide to buy a house, they can put at least 20% down and never have to pay PMI.  PMI is a huge cost.\n\nAnd assuming OP is in 20s, a 25 year retirement plan is not unreasonable.  The FI/RE crowd is doing it in 10 or 15 years.

If they get paid, then they can put food on their tables.\n\nThey don't care why you might want to do it or that you might be worse off after you do it than before.  They just care that you do it.\n\nYou don't need to worry about that other than to understand it.  They can't force you to refinance against your will or anything.\n\nWhat you need to worry about is whether it's a solid financial move.  That has nothing to do with when you get these letters.  Not like somebody is watching out for a time when you get maximum benefits before sending these things.  They send to everybody that owns a house.\n\nThere are not very many good reasons to refinance and pretty much none of them sound like \"because I received snail mail saying I should\".\n\nRefinancing will allow you to change the terms of your agreement and it will cost fees to do it.\n\nA few examples of reasonable times to refinance:\n\n1) You have a lot of equity in your house and you really need to spend that.\n\nIt's important that this is more \"need\" than \"want\" if you ever want to have any wealth.  That said, a cash out refinance is a decent way to get money which could be used to, say, pay off lots of credit card debt.  You would be changing the interest rate on the debt from 20%+ to instead be something like 5% or less, which is a good trade.\n\n2) If you need to reduce your monthly payment.\n\nIt's possible that you have owned a house for 10 years or something and you lose your job and it becomes harder to make that payment.  Doing a refinance here, so that you go from 20y left to another 30y loan would reduce your monthly payment considerably, potentially making it easier to avoid defaulting.\n\nThis is another one of those things that you generally want to do only when absolutely necessary.  Nobody ever gets rich by continually refinancing to a longer term.  The maximum interest is paid when the loan takes as long as possible to pay off and when the payments toward the principal are the lowest.  Refinancing puts you right back to the time when the least possible money is going towards the balance.\n\nDon't do it because you want to reduce your monthly payment so you can spend more on lifestyle.\n\n3) If it will result in a lower total expense.\n\nPlenty of people have gotten great results by refinancing down their interest rates, particularly if they intend to stay in the house for long periods.  Long enough that the reduction in interest owed results in making up for the refinance fees plus some.\n\nGenerally speaking, the people that benefit here are the people that bought in high interest rate environments when the interest rates subsequently went far down.  If you aren't seeing an APR go down by 1% or more, you may not make up the fees with reduced interest.

I use categories like: housing, electricity, gas, water, groceries, going out to eat, gasoline, needs for the house, my personal spending allowance, my wife's personal spending allowance, pets, vacations, insurance, subscriptions, house repairs. List everything that you spend money on.\n\nFrom there my big goal is to eliminate wasteful spending by tracking my numbers. This does NOT mean stop going out to eat or buying crap that you want, but it does mean being intentional about it. Decide if you really want it or if it will bring happiness into your life. \n\nI found that many times the answer would be no and I would save the money instead.

Pick some place with a climate that you like, with a vibrant and growing economy, which has need for the trade you are interested in.  Move there and take a job as an EMT, with the goal of training for a trade.  Find a roommate.  Complete any training needed for your chosen trade and then start working it.  If you can't see yourself doing that, repeat the whole training and taking an new job process, moving if you need to, until you find something that you're good at, and that you enjoy, and that allows you to live and save.\n\nFinally, very few people like their job, or they would like it a lot more if they didn't have to do it.  Those who are able to do a job they like usually put in a lot of work and paid a lot of dues to get to that position, either by achieving financial independence, or by focusing on that job/field because they enjoy it, and then working really hard to be the best at it that they can be.\n\nThe world has done younger generations a bit of disservice, by overvaluing college degrees.  \"White collar\" jobs are treated as superior to blue collar jobs.  For some reason, if you get dirty doing a job, it's often less respected than a cube job.  Mike Rowe, the guy from \"Dirty Jobs\" currently spends his time evangelizing the trades.  OTR drivers, welders, HVAC technicians, electricians, pipefitters, the list goes on.  So many of these are desperate to fill the positions.  He gives examples of welders who work flexible schedules, part time hours, and pay taxes on 100k.  I'm sure this is rare, but even half that for full time would be double what you're making now.  My understanding is that a new welder who's taken a certification but without experience can pull in $20 an hour in most markets.  I know HVAC techs can start in the mid to high teens.  The demand for some trades is so high that they advertise to get people to come to training classes, and for OTR drivers, I think they often repay the training costs if you graduate and get your license and sign on to work for a year or two.", "title": "Am barebones as I can be.

Because you co-own rental property with your mother, you very likely each have an interest in a partnership. Assuming your previous CPA was preparing Form 1065 for your rental property and also preparing your personal return, I think $450 actually sounds pretty reasonable. \n\nA partnership is generally formed when two or more parties intend to act jointly in conducting a business with the intent to share in its profits and losses. The parties' intent, rather than the particular label they assign to their form of operation, determines the existence of a partnership. Intent to form a partnership is determined based on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. Factors that traditionally indicate the existence of a partnership include a profit motive, an agreement to share losses, ownership of capital interests in the business venture, participation in management, or a written partnership agreement ( W.O. Culbertson, SCt, 49-1 ustc \u00b69323 ).\n\nYou should be filing Form 1065 to report the earnings from the rental business, and you and your mother should be getting a K-1 to pick the earnings up in your personal tax returns. The partnership should also be reimbursing you for your expenses, but I suspect that's not how you're doing it. Depreciation rules are also somewhat complicated, so you probably want someone to help with that as well.\n\nThe HSA, student loans, 401(k), and W-2 earnings (plus K-1 earnings from your rental property partnership) are all pretty easy and probably don't require any help.

Unless there is something special about your car (something classic or a high-end luxury vehicle) then any car with 160k on it usually isn't even given a value by KBB.

This notice will show any payment you made, the unpaid tax, and the initial assessments of the Failure to Pay (FTP) penalty and interest. \n\nThe FTP is generally 0.5% of the unpaid tax, charged per month or part of a month. \n\nThe IRS interest rate is currently 6% per year, compounded daily on the unpaid tax and penalties. The rate can be increased or decreased on a quarterly basis. \n\nIf you are able to full pay this by the notice due date, you are done.\n\nIf you can't, you need a payment plan.\n\nIf you think you could pay in 120 days or fewer, you want a Full Payment Agreement. This begins the day you make the request by phone, face-to-face, or [using Online Payment Agreement](https://www.irs.gov/payments/online-payment-agreement-application) (OPA). During the 120 days, the FTP and interest accrue, but you aren't obliged to make a fixed monthly payment. Send as much as you can as often as you can, one payment or twenty payments.\n\nIf you need five months or more, you want a formal Installment Agreement (IA). With this plan, you agree to a fixed monthly payment and a regular due date each month (1st - 28th). The general rule for a minimum payment is (amount due on 1st notice / 72), so roughly $45.00. Once an IA is established, the FTP rate is reduced to 0.25% of the unpaid tax per month. You can request the IA by phone, face-to-face, using OPA, or by sending [IRS Form 9465](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-9465) with your federal return (electronically or by mail), or just mailing the form. \n\nYou can request to have the monthly payments automatically debited from your checking account using OPA or Form 9465. This is a Direct Debit Installment Agreement (DDIA). \n\nEvery Installment Agreement has a one-time user fee. This fee can range from $31 to $225, depending on the terms and conditions. Generally, using OPA to establish the DDIA will result in the lowest possible fee. \n\nIf the IA defaults for any reason (missed or late payment, payment for less than the minimum, a new balance due on a future return) the Services charges another user fee to reinstate the IA, from $43 to $89, again depending on the terms and conditions of the original agreement. \n\nMost IRS payment plans require filing compliance. IRS will review your account to be sure all required returns are filed for, in most cases, tax years 2013 through 2018. \n\nIf you choose to establish a payment plan using [Online Payment Agreement](https://www.irs.gov/payments/online-payment-agreement-application), I encourage you to wait until you receive the first balance due notice. \n\nThe general IRS customer service line is  toll-free at 1-800-829-1040 M - F 7am - 7pm local time.\n\nYou can request face-to-face help by calling IRS at 1-844-545-5640 M - F 7am - 7pm local time to make an appointment at your local Taxpayer Assistance Center.

It's unlikely we will see rates fall into the mid-high 3s again unless we see something akin to 2008 again, and even then, a drop that big would only come back during the recovery.\n\nMany people that closed on their homes mid-late last year are considering a refinance right now. Costs would be somewhere between $2500-3000 depending on what region you are in. If you are in a market where property values are increasing, you may even get an appraisal waiver which will save you $500-700 on the inspection fee.\n\nWith rates this low, you probably don't want to pay any significant amount of points (.25% is the maximum I would recommend in this kind of environment) since paying points will increase the length of time/number of payments that you will need to break even. You can have your fees rolled into your loan amount to reduce/eliminate out of pocket costs, but that is subject to how much equity you have available.\n\nIn general, rolling fees into the loan amount is a more cost effective long term strategy than taking a large lender credit with a higher-than-market rate to cover the fees. This strategy changes if you are planning on selling within a narrow timeframe close to your savings break-even date.\n\nYou may be toeing the line of getting an appraisal waiver with your equity level right at 20%, so finding the right balance on your loan amount is crucial to achieving that.\n\nIf you have the willpower/budget to do so, continue making your current mortgage payment amount on your new, lower rate loan.

To prevent having to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI)\n\nKnowing that you'd be getting it for $20k under market value mitigates #1 somewhat, but has no impact on #2.  If you're ok with throwing away PMI money (probably around $137/month), then I'd adjust the down payment requirement to $13k.  You may also be able to work with a lender to play with this a bit.  For instance, they may waive the PMI if you get the house appraised at the +$20k value.  What they're looking for here is that you only owe 80% of what the house is worth.  If you go this route, though, you may want to give the seller a heads-up that they need to file a form 709 (gift tax return) with the IRS, because that's a $20k gift, and without filing that form, it could cost them some money.\n\nBut even at $20k under market value, an emergency fund of 6 months of expenses is an absolute must-have.

Credit cards feed off people with unhealthy spending habits.\n\n1. Signing bonuses. Plenty of credit cards offer bonuses if you spend a certain amount of money in a certain amount of time. For example, $100 statement balance if you spend $500 in the first 90 days of opening the account. The goal is to get you to spend more money than you have, then charge you interest on it.\n\n2. 0% interest periods. This is another signing bonus type thing. For example, no interest charged in the first 15 months of signing. The goal here is to get you to only make minimum payments and then build a huge balance you won't be able to afford when the 0% interest period is over \n\n3. Minimum payments. When you get a statement balance, you'll see \"full amount\" and \"minimum payment\". If you don't pay the minimum payment, you will be charged extra fees. If you don't pay the full amount, you will be charged interest on your next statement based on your remaining balance.\n\n4. Annual fees. Some cards have annual fees. They usually also have amazing rewards if you use them often enough, but might be best to avoid.\n\nThese are things to watch out for with credit cards. They aren't necessarily good or bad, but they are risky and you need to understand them.\n\nNormal advice: Meet the spending bonus with normal purchases. Pay your statement balance in full each month. Avoid annual fees.\n\nThere are plenty of benefits as well. Like you mentioned, cash back or points. This is an awesome system in which you get money back for using your card, usually for specific categories of purchase.\n\n- Uber Credit Card. 4% cash back on dining. 3% on hotels, and airfare. Also has a signing bonus. Look it up for more details.\n- CapitalOne SavorOne. 3% cash back on entertainment. Has a signing bonus and a 0% interest period.\n- Citi Double Cash. 2% cash back on all purchases. I use this for everything else, including monthly bills.\n\nI don't have this card because I don't drive, but I recommend it.\n\n- Gas. Duck's Unlimited credit gives 5% cash back on gas.\n\nSo, by using the right card for the right purchase, you get a discount on the purchase. Compared to a debit card, this is immediately a huge benefit. Assuming you paid your full statement balance every month, you'd never be at risk and you would save money by using a credit card.\n\nAnother benefit of a credit card is that you get to keep the \"tangible\" money on hand for longer. This is especially good if you have a high interest savings account. For example, I'm making minimum payments on one of my cards until April of next year when the 0% interest period ends. However, I'm depositing the remaining balance amount into a savings account at 2.2% APY. Next April, I'll pay the balance in full and have earned more money than if I just paid it as I went.\n\nCredit cards are the enemy, but...keep your enemies close. Understand them. Utilize them.

My husband asked him if his work isn\u2019t up to par with the expectations of the position and his boss told him his work was great and better than anyone who has tried to fix the departments. \n\nThese aren't really weak excuses. Your husband has gotten to a level where intra-corporate politics are very real and very important. It's possible that the COO is just stalling but it's also very possible that people have gone looking for raises, gotten shut down, and put the CEO in a bad mood about raises. CEOs are human and can and often do make emotional decisions.\n\n> He got the job done and know his boss isn\u2019t ready to run it trough his CEO. (Shouldn\u2019t he have the authority on his own as COO?). \n\nFor something as big as a VP's salary, no the COO can't just unilaterally decide what to pay junior executives. I'm at a small company as well and our executive team has to consult with the board when it comes to budgetary matters. Not only does the COO have to run a raise / promotion by the CEO, but in deciding whether or not to approve it the CEO will have to either talk to the board or at least think about how that will fit into directives passed from the board to the CEO. (Replace board with owners if this is a private company)\n\n> Reject the promotion and stay at his current position and salary. \n\nDon't do this over salary, this is a decision about career trajectory. If he can handle the job he should not reject it.\n\n> He can keep doing the work and wait for the raise to come eventually.

Then it doesn't look like he is failing at the work, just that he wants to leverage his new experience into a better offer at another company - prospective employers will understand that. I wouldn't go around saying that my current company stiffed me on a raise and that's why I'm looking, though, in fact I wouldn't mention my current salary at all and just stick to labour stats when picking a salary to aim for.

It\u2019s hard for us to remember that you\u2019re in high school\u2014 a lot of fully grown adults don\u2019t handle money responsibly/intelligently and so we are used to being a little harsh on them.  \n\nHere\u2019s my general advice. \n\nResearch apartments in the area and pick a \u201cgoal apartment\u201d.  Don\u2019t just look at the prices\u2014 really read about all the apartments, some have utilities included and some you have to pay more; some have washing machines and some you would have to pay for a laundromat; some have terrible mold and bugs and you don\u2019t want to live there.  Rents depend a lot on location, so people on here won\u2019t be able to give an average range (where I live you can\u2019t find a one bedroom under 1000).  \n\nYou can look for apartments with prof management companies on apartments.com or something similar.  \n\nDepending on the amount of young people and general sketchiness of your area, you can also look on Craigslist for people renting out their basement or a spare room or two.  For some of these, you\u2019ll sign a lease with the homeowner, and for some it might be more of an under the table, just Venmo me rent thing.  There are pros and cons to this obviously.  When I rented someone\u2019s basement studio i didn\u2019t have a real lease which meant I couldn\u2019t legally change my address and that might cause issues with school/financial aid stuff. \n\nOnce you have a \u201cgoal apartment\u201d price, both of you should save up at least (ideally more) 3 months rent (which would be half of the listed rent) AND try to aim for a job where you\u2019ll be earning 3x your rent amount per month.  Also keep in mind that there will be a big expense when you first move in\u2014 most places take a deposit of about a months rent and maybe a signing fee or parking pass fee and you\u2019ll also have to get some furniture and home goods that you might not be used to having to buy. \n\nFor creating a realistic budget (for groceries, gas, fun stuff, etc) YouTube is actually a great place to learn about budgeting-there are a ton of \u201cset up my monthly budget with me\u201d videos and budgeting app reviews (I would recommend YNAB as an app, especially if you\u2019re work is inconsistent.)", "title": "I Need To Leave My House", "num_comments": 15, "downs": 0, "author": "t2_49gt6ms", "score": 1, "submitter": false, "ups": 1, "contro": 0}, "ejwey9a": {"body": "Yeah you are way over complicating this.

That'd be 41 years ago, so half way through the dad's working life. IRAs were invented in 1974. 45 years ago. \n\nThe people who are retiring now are stuck Ina weird spot of their parents either working till they died or having a company retirement plan. So they planned for that.

I know this because we almost bought a $330k house this month here in TX even though we can technically afford nearly double that. Why? Because past a certain income level  ($100k I\u2019d say) in central Texas, you can buy what you want for a reasonable price and still be in a good school district. No one spends top budget if they\u2019re practical. Thus, taxes can\u2019t really be measured directly like you\u2019re doing.
